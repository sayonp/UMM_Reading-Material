               suggests that topological and geometric complexity are critically
               involved in how people navigate urban grids. This has caused
               difficulties with orthodox urban modelling, since it has always
               been assumed that insofar as spatial factors play a role in
               navigation, it will be on the basis of metric distance. In spite
               of much experimental evidence from cognitive science that
               geometric and topological factors are involved in navigation, and
               that metric distance is unlikely to be the best criterion for
               navigational choices, the matter has not been convincingly
               resolved since no method has existed for extracting cognitive
               information from aggregate flows. Within the space syntax
               literature it has also remained unclear how far the correlations
               that are found with syntactic variables at the level of aggregate
               flows are due to cognitive factors operating at the level of
               individual movers, or they are simply mathematically probable
               network effects, that is emergent statistical effects from the
               structure of line networks, independent of the psychology of
               navigational choices. Here we suggest how both problems can be
               resolved, by showing three things: first, how cognitive
               inferences can be made from aggregate urban flow data and
               distinguished from network effects; second by showing that urban
               movement, both vehicular and pedestrian, are shaped far more by
               the geometrical and topological properties of the grid than by
               its metric properties; and third by demonstrating that the
               influence of these factors on movement is a cognitive, not
               network, effect.",

               researchers. It provides a step-by-step approach for its
               application in urban planning and design. This textbook aims to
               increase the accessibility of the space syntax method for the
               first time to all graduate students and researchers who are
               dealing with the built environment, such as those in the field of
               architecture, urban design and planning, urban sociology, urban
               geography, archaeology, road engineering, and environmental
               psychology. Taking a didactical approach, the authors have
               structured each chapter to explain key concepts and show
               practical examples followed by underlying theory and provided
               exercises to facilitate learning in each chapter. The textbook
               gradually eases the reader into the fundamental concepts and
               leads them towards complex theories and applications. In summary,
               the general competencies gain after reading this book are: – to
               understand, explain, and discuss space syntax as a method and
               theory; – be capable of undertaking various space syntax analyses
               such as axial analysis, segment analysis, point depth analysis,
               or visibility analysis; – be able to apply space syntax for urban
               research and design practice; – be able to interpret and evaluate
               space syntax analysis results and embed these in a wider context;
               – be capable of producing new original work using space syntax.
               This holistic textbook functions as compulsory literature for
               spatial analysis courses where space syntax is part of the
               methods taught. Likewise, this space syntax book is useful for
               graduate students and researchers who want to do self-study.
               Furthermore, the book provides readers with the fundamental
               knowledge to understand and critically reflect on existing

               have been applied to urban studies. This method consists of
               calculating configurative spatial relationships in built
               environments. In urban analyses, according to Hillier, space
               syntax is four things. Firstly, it is a way to represent urban
               space. Secondly, it is a family of techniques for analysing
               cities as the networks of space formed by the placing, grouping
               and orientation of buildings. Thirdly, it is a set of techniques
               for observing how these networks of space relate to functional
               patterns such as movement, land use, area differentiation,
               migration patterns and even social wellbeing and malaise.
               Fourthly, space syntax has made it possible to make a set of
               theories about how urban space networks relate in general to the
               social, economic and cognitive factors which shape them and are
               affected by them. The techniques have been applied worldwide to a
               large number of cities. In this way a substantial database now
               exists (Hillier, Cities and urban societies: The role of
               endogenous factors, 2007). The purpose of this chapter is to
               present the various elements of the space syntax method and how
               they have contributed to understandings and theories on urban
               space and society, and to position the tool within a geodesign
               process. A consistent methodology and theories is necessary for

              a checking habit: brief, repetitive inspection of dynamic content

              and frequencies of checking behaviors in three studies. We found

              with the device and may increase usage overall. Data from a
              controlled field experiment show that checking behaviors emerge
              and are reinforced by informational ``rewards'' that are very

               during the pandemic. Eviction and housing displacement are
               particularly threatening to individual and public health during a
               pandemic. Eviction is likely to increase COVID-19 infection rates
               because it results in overcrowded living environments, doubling
               up, transiency, limited access to healthcare, and a decreased
               ability to comply with pandemic mitigation strategies (e.g.,
               social distancing, self-quarantine, and hygiene practices).
               Indeed, recent studies suggest that eviction may increase the
               spread of COVID-19 and that the absence or lifting of eviction
               moratoria may be associated with an increased rate of COVID-19
               infection and death. Eviction is also a driver of health inequity
               as historic trends, and recent data demonstrate that people of
               color are more likely to face eviction and associated
               comorbidities. Black people have had less confidence in their
               ability to pay rent and are dying at 2.1 times the rate of
               non-Hispanic Whites. Indigenous Americans and Hispanic/Latinx
               people face an infection rate almost 3 times the rate of
               non-Hispanic whites. Disproportionate rates of both COVID-19 and
               eviction in communities of color compound negative health effects
               make eviction prevention a critical intervention to address
               racial health inequity. In light of the undisputed connection
               between eviction and health outcomes, eviction prevention,
               through moratoria and other supportive measures, is a key
               component of pandemic control strategies to mitigate COVID-19
               spread and death.",

               (Active Seattle) advocated for policies and projects in diverse
               communities supporting a more walkable city, while using social
               marketing and education to get more people walking more often.
               INTERVENTION: Walking audits were carried out in select diverse
               neighborhoods, resulting in recommendations for policy change and
               built-environment improvements. Advocacy for city-scale policies
               also occurred. Walking maps and other social-marketing products
               promoted behavior change. Major Safe Routes to School activities
               occurred and were made possible by separate funding sources.
               RESULTS: Positive results of Active Seattle included an increase
               in funding for pedestrian infrastructure, a pedestrian master
               plan, a Complete Streets policy, substantial increase in Safe
               Routes to School activity, and institutionalization of active
               living and active transportation within partner agencies.
               Challenges included institutional prioritization for improving
               pedestrian infrastructure, funding inequity, and a community need
               that was greater than could be fulfilled. LESSONS LEARNED:
               Efforts to overcome funding inequities or other resistance to
               pedestrian-oriented physical projects will benefit from
               high-visibility campaigns that have a lasting impact on public
               perception and decision makers' political will. To reach
               vulnerable populations that have substantial barriers to
               increasing walking frequency, extensive staff time for outreach
               is needed. Changing the built environment to encourage walking
               may be a long-term solution in communities with diverse
               populations. CONCLUSIONS: Influencing and educating local
               government officials to make active living projects and policies
               a high budgetary priority is essential for large-scale impact and

  abstract = "Urbanization processes are manifested by the change in the
              physical morphology of cities. Gaining knowledge about cities
              through their morphology is naturally linked to the capability of
              remote sensing (RS) that can monitor city forms with a synoptic
              view. Yet, our knowledge of the urban form does not linearly
              increase with the increase of image data. Thus, the role,
              challenges and potentials of RS in deriving knowledge about urban
              morphology are worth investigating. We argue that ongoing efforts
              of mapping urban elements in RS are only marginally contributing
              to the understanding of cities in terms of urban morphology. We
              further reason that magnifying the role of RS depends on a
              suggested workflow involving steps that are external to RS, mainly
              including characterizing urban morphology through meaningful
              measurements of mapped elements, and interpreting the measured
              physical forms as proxies of the socioeconomic status. To
              exemplify the major steps, we focus on urban poverty
              (deprivation), and examine its manifestation through the
              morphology of buildings. Our findings show that challenges appear
              as soon as the collection of building information from RS images
              starts. This is mainly caused by inconsistent, incomplete and
              inaccurate GIS based representation of buildings on images, as
              well as low quality predictions, hidden from accuracy metrics.
              Although the potential of deriving meaningful urban morphological
              patterns from building maps for explaining socioeconomic patterns
              still holds, several uncertainties remain unsolved, such as the
              way urban processes are manifested morphologically and how the
              morphology is captured with the influence of building map quality.
              Our main conclusion is that as RS image-based morphological
              information propagates and fluctuates along the process of
              knowledge derivation, causing difficulties in quantifying the
              exact amount of urban knowledge derived. Nonetheless, useful
              knowledge could already be obtained even with suboptimal data
              sources and model performances, which opens the opportunity to
              facilitate transferable and reproducible urban morphology studies

               physical compactness while limited attention has been paid to
               functional zoning of urban areas. Here, we introduce a novel
               index, called the functional compactness index (FCI), to quantify
               urban functional compactness through the integration of
               geospatial data sources, including Points of Interest (POIs)
               data, Road Network of OpenStreetMap (RNO) data, and National
               Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging

               require the analysis of the grid scale and thus, is technically
               simpler than conventional compactness index (CI). We examined the
               effectiveness of FCI on estimating urban compactness under four
               land use scenarios and in four Chinese cities. The results
               suggest that: (1) the FCI can comprehensively reflect the
               intensity of human activity, the differentiation between
               residential zones and other functional zones, and the mixing
               degree of different functional zones; (2) the FCI is not affected
               by the service radius of residential zones; (3) the FCI can
               reflect the overall and local-scale functional compactness of a
               city; and (4) the FCI can be used to effectively compare spatial
               characteristics of functional compactness among different cities.
               In conclusion, the FCI considers the rationality of urban
               functional layout, which not only is helpful for urban planning,

              prominence of Kailash in the whole region, and also the change in

              In addition, most previous studies have evaluated perception of

               investigating epistemological foundations of place research

               Specifically, a deep learning model, which has been trained on
               millions of human ratings of street-level imagery, was used to
               predict human perceptions of a street view image. The model

               becoming of increasingly wide interest: the relationship between
               urban form and social segregation.The issue begins with an
               overview by Bill Hillier and Laura Vaughan of space syntax as a
               theory of the city and a set of techniques for analysing its
               spatial form. This is followed by a chapter by Laura Vaughan that
               analyses poverty and spatial form in Charles Booth's maps of 19th
               century London, describing new findings relating to the
               persistence of poverty areas and immigrant 'ghettos' and
               proposing a spatially defined line of poverty, distinguishing
               between poor, spatially segregated streets and more prosperous,
               spatially integrated streets. Following this, a chapter by Lars
               Marcus suggests that segregation is inherently a spatial problem.
               Hedemonstrates this through a detailed analysis of residential
               segregation and social integration in public space of housing
               estates constructed through the Swedish Million Homes Programme.
               In the penultimate chapter Ruth Conroy Dalton discusses

               exclusion, transportation equality, transit equity and leisure
               trail use in Peachtree City, Georgia, showing that the

               their lack of access to public/private transport iseffectively

               integrated into the visual walkability index (VWI), whose
               reliability is validated through manual interpretation and a

               and including public health. This evidence supports promoting
               rich and thriving neighbourhoods in order to encourage short

               (EMQ06), undertaken in Spain, to measure short-distance
               travelling within Barcelona and to assess how distinct social
               groups make use of the local scale for their everyday mobility.
               The effects of socioeconomics and access to transport are
               discussed, prior to applying a Chi-squared Automatic Interaction
               Detection (CHAID) method, in order to explore heterogeneity among

               frequently undertaken for personal purposes. Also, age, gender

               Pedestrian perceptions information was obtained through a user
               survey completed by pedestrians using the study site. It was
               found that unsignalized midblock crosswalks were the treatment of

               most influential decision factor for pedestrians deciding to
               cross at a designated location (90\% said so). Proper traffic

               signal to influence pedestrians’ decisions to cross at a specific

              culturally signiﬁcant activities. Using a big-data approach, four
              geospatial analyses are applied to every cultic place in the
              Peloponnesian regions of the Argolid and Messenia, spanning
              2800–146 BC. The fully described methodology combines a number of
              experiences—looking out, looking toward, and climbing up—and
              measures how these change through time. The result is an active
              historic model of Greek religious landscape, describing how
              individuals moved, saw, and integrated the built and natural world
              in different ways. Applied elsewhere, and even on nonreligious
              locales, this is a replicable mode for treating the natural
              landscape as an artifact of human decision: as a space impacting
              the siting of meaningful locales through history.",

               conditions and the mental health of populations across European
               countries. We analyzed survey data collected during spring 2020
               from 69,136 individuals from four cohorts from Denmark, France,
               and the UK. The investigated housing conditions included
               household density, composition, and crowding, access to outdoor
               facilities, dwelling type, and urbanicity. The outcomes were
               loneliness, anxiety, and life satisfaction. Logistic regression
               models were used, and results were pooled using random-effects
               meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, living alone was associated
               with higher levels of loneliness (OR = 3.08, 95\% CI 1.87-5.07),
               and lower life satisfaction (OR = 1.27, 95\% CI 1.05-0.55),

               space and household crowding were suggestively associated with
               worse outcomes. Living in crowded households, living alone, or
               lacking access to outdoor facilities may be particularly
               important in contributing to poor mental health during a
               lockdown. Addressing the observed fundamental issues related to

              this paper is to make the spatial dimension of this process more

              in different regions of the world, there are also powerful
              invariants. The problem is to understand how both cultural
              variations and invariants can arise from the spatial processes
              that generate cities. The answer proposed is that socio-cultural
              factors generate the differences by imposing a certain local
              geometry on the local construction of settlement space, while
              micro-economic factors, coming more and more into play as the

               search behaviour is complex and emergent since it relates to
               settlement morphology and land-use pattern, both of which
               themselves result from human activity. Recently, agent simulation
               experiments have been used to study patterns of emergent
               behaviour in the dynamics of crowd movement and in the
               construction of paths through open space. Here we report
               simulations in which agents are given long-distance vision and
               direct their behaviour in response to information from the entire
               cone of vision afforded by the morphology of the local
               environment and their gaze direction. We show that the morphology
               of the environment and the location and aggregation patterns of
               resources within that environment affect the efficiency with
               which these agents can conduct their search. Linear streets and

               this process was formalized at the beginning of the 20th century
               as urban design, its rationale as a discipline has been fraught
               with consequence. It has been continuously defined as other –
               half way between the two professions of architecture and urban
               planning. This unjustified otherness has been reflected in
               approaches to urban design theory. Even the middle ground which
               urban design is supposed to occupy is an amalgam of architectural
               and planning ideologies and practices. The following paper takes
               a hard look at the last 50 years, exposing the most serious
               attempts to synthesize or theorize significant urban design
               paradigms. While each attempt has much to commend it, variously
               exhibiting great insight, dedication, knowledge and scholarship,
               I feel that the collective result has been a generalized anarchy
               of creative ideas that bear little coherence, either internally
               or collectively. Whether this is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ is beside the
               point, it is where evolution has brought us. Nor does this
               situation signify any immunity on my part to the uses of
               disorder, chance and chaos, in the spirit that ‘there is no idea,
               however ancient and absurd, that is not capable of improving our
               knowledge’ (Feyerabend, 1975, p. 33). The hypothesis explored
               below proposes that the failure has an obvious cause – there has
               been no concerted attempt within the discipline to link the
               material creation or ‘designing’ of urban space and form to
               fundamental societal processes. More importantly, this linkage is
               desirable, and can be made. The fracture has many causes –
               historical, professional, ideological, academic, egocentric, as
               well as misplaced idealism. Rather than pursuing the quest for an
               integrated theory which has little possibility of success, I
               argue that a better outcome already exists in spatial political
               economy, itself a somewhat anarchistic pursuit, but one of better
               quality. The framework of ideas which it encompasses offers urban
               design both legitimation and theoretical coherence. In so doing,
               urban design can exit the nefarious middle ground allocated to it
               by architecture and planning. Instead, it can connect directly to
               the economic, political, social and cultural processes which
               structure social life.",

              developments in applying configurational analysis to issues of
              architectural and urban theory. The paper reports a fundamental
              research finding: that movement in the urban grid is, all other
              things being equal, generated by the configuration of the grid
              itself. This finding allows completely new insights into the
              structure of urban grids, and the way these stuctures relate to
              urban function. The relation between grid and movement in fact
              underlies many other aspects of urban form: the distribution of
              land uses such as retail and residence, spatial patterning of
              crime, the evolution of different densities and even the
              part-whole structure of cities. The influence of the fundamental
              grid-movement relation is so pervasive that cities are
              conceptualized here as 'movement economies', in which the
              structuring of movement by the grid leads, through multiplier
              effects, to dense patterns of mixed use encounter that
              characterize the spatially successful city.",

               embodiment of practice; its hybrid epistemology; its relational
               concept of space; and the reaffirmation of space as a living
               dimension. On the other hand, it shall discuss the limits of the
               theory concerning society–space relations: the reduction of
               social practice to movement, human interaction to social
               interfaces and encounter, and the actor to bodily presence; the
               primacy of syntax over semantics; the problem of time in the
               structuring of space; and the difficulties of theoretical
               contribution. Finally I look to discuss the theory’s place
               regarding distinctions between urban and sociospatial theories,
               and dilemmas to be faced in its future development.",

               people-based measures of accessibility in the context of public
               service delivery. While place-based measures examine the spatial
               separation between service locations and in a single reference
               location, people-based measures are based on detailed
               observations of an individual's activity schedule and
               spaceâ€“time constraints. The aim of this paper is to contribute
               to previous methodological studies of accessibility by
               investigating the extent to which utility-based measures relying
               on the Burnsâ€“Miller framework relate to place- based and other
               people-based measures of individual accessibility. In total, four
               place-based and six people-based measures that are frequently
               used to evaluate urban service delivery are analyzed. The
               relationships between these measures are examined and their
               implications for the assessment of equity of urban service
               distribution are evaluated. We have found substantial differences
               between place-based and people-based measures, supporting
               previous findings in the relevant literature and extending them
               to utility-based spaceâ€“time measures of accessibility. We also
               observed substantial differences within the group of people-based
               measures. It appears that measures which express the cardinality
               of a feasible opportunity choice set are quite different from
               measures which express the desirability of such a set. The
               salience of this difference is also borne out by the measurement
               of statistical dispersion of accessibility values, indicating
               that different measures provide markedly different insights into
               how equally service delivery is distributed among the population.",

               different societies produce different spatial orders through
               building forms and settlement patterns. It consists of three
               parts. Firstly, at a metatheoretical level, it is suggested that
               spatial organization should be seen as a member of a family of
               ?morphic languages? which are unlike both natural and
               mathematical languages but which borrow properties from each. In
               general, morphic languages are used to constitute rather than
               represent the social through their syntax (that is the systematic
               production of pattern). Secondly, a general syntactic theory of
               space organization is proposed. It is argued that spatial
               patterns in both complex buildings and settlements fall into
               eight major types, which are interrelated in structural ways.
               Finally, the syntactic theory is used to integrate a number of
               recent general propositions made in anthropology regarding human
               space organization.",

               environment. The shape and size of an isovist is liable to change
               with position. Numerical measures are proposed that quantify some
               salient size and shape features. These measures in turn create a
               set of scalar isovist fields. Sets of isovists and isovist fields
               form an alternative description of environments. The method seems
               relevant to behavioral and perceptual studies in architecture,

               latter role it is hoped that an information-field theory such as

              out of scale with their surrounding urban space, is discussed and
              applied. It is based on the viewshed analysis as developed in
              rural landscape studies, but it also takes into account the
              peculiarity emerging from the urban studies. In order to go beyond
              the sole information of whether a cell is, or is not, visible,
              which is typical of viewshed analyses, in this work the various
              factors that cause the visual attenuation with the distance are
              discussed and quantitatively assessed by determining various
              limit-of-visibility distances that may also be time variable.
              These factors are the visual acuity, the contrast between the
              target and its surroundings, the atmospheric visibility, and the

               systems to be navigated and eventually filled up by traffic. A
               new type of ?configurational? road network modelling, coupled to
               detailed studies of vehicular and pedestrian flows, has shown
               that road networks have a much more constructive role. They
               strongly influence the pattern of flows through quantifiable
               properties of the network ?configuration?. Recent research
               results are presented showing that rates of vehicular movement in
               road segments are to a greater extent than previously realised
               the direct outcome of the location of those segments in the
               network configuration as a whole and that this is the case
               especially in the fine structure of the urban grid. A supply and
               demand model of urban movement is proposed in which the degree to
               which a street alignment is on simplest routes between all other
               pairs of alignments in the system determines the demand side of
               the equation, and the effective road width available to traffic
               determines the supply side. Regression analysis shows that these
               two factors alone account for the majority of the variance in
               flows from street to street (r2 ? 0.8). A model is then proposed
               of the evolution of the city in allocation of land uses to land
               parcels, and the allocation of capacity in the road network,
               where each reinforces the underlaying configurational logic

               street width, to arrive at a better controlled relationship
               between vehicles and pedestrians in urban areas. As these design
               parameters are under the direct control of the urban
               master-planner, the new techniques lend themselves to application
               in design decision support. A case example of the application of

               segregation of cities and the privatization of public space and,

               public sphere, addresses these tensions and contributes to the

               dealing with certain geometrical configurations. At a simple
               level, the analysis of regularly gridded urban textures (such as
               Manhattan's) reveals the difficulty of accepting the claim that
               space syntax allows the modelling of pedestrian choice making. In
               more complex cases, the distortion of two ideal textures produces
               a topological discontinuity, leading to the unacceptable
               situation where one single urban configuration produces two
               conflicting outcomes when analysed with space syntax tools.
               Several other points are also discussed, such as the difficulty
               of space syntax to take into account building height and land
               use, and its sensitivity to boundary conditions. Conclusions seem
               to suggest that the topological representation of cities, on
               which space syntax is based, discards precious metric information
               and is rather limiting. It is envisaged that with current

               cases has a long tradition, especially in transportation or

               design has brought its contribution by means of the ‘space
               syntax’ methodology. All these approaches-though under different
               terms like ‘accessibility’, ‘proximity’, ‘integration’
               ‘connectivity’, ‘cost’, or ‘effort’-focus on the idea that some
               places (or streets) are more important than others because they
               are more central. The study of centrality in complex systems,
               however, originated in other scientific areas, namely in
               structural sociology, well before its use in urban studies;
               moreover, as a structural property of the system, centrality has
               never been extensively investigated metrically in geographic
               networks as it has been topologically in a wide range of other
               relational networks such as social, biological, or technological
               ones. After a previous work on some structural properties of the
               primal graph representation of urban street networks, in this
               paper we provide an in-depth investigation of centrality in the
               primal approach as compared with the dual one. We introduce
               multiple centrality assessment (MCA), a methodology for
               geographic network analysis, which is defined and implemented on
               four 1-square-mile urban street systems. MCA provides a different
               perspective from space syntax in that: (1) it is based on primal,
               rather than dual, street graphs; (2) it works within a metric,
               rather than topological, framework; (3) it investigates a
               plurality of peer centrality indices rather than a single index.
               We show that, in the MCA primal approach, much more than in the
               dual approach, some centrality indices nicely capture the
               ‘skeleton’ of the urban structure that impacts so much on spatial
               cognition and collective behaviours. Moreover, the distributions
               of centrality in self-organized cities are different from those

               characterise urban forms at the metropolitan level and, in
               particular, to distinguish compactness from 'sprawl'. It first
               reviews and analyses past research on the definitions of urban
               form, compactness and sprawl, and corresponding quantitative
               variables. Four quantitative variables are developed to measure
               four dimensions of urban form at the metropolitan level:
               metropolitan size, activity intensity, the degree that activities
               are evenly distributed, and the extent that high-density
               sub-areas are clustered. Through a series of simulation analyses,
               the global Moran coefficient, which characterises the fourth
               dimension, distinguishes compactness from sprawl. It is high,
               intermediate and close to zero for monocentric, polycentric and
               decentralised sprawling forms respectively. In addition, the more
               there is more local sprawl, composed of discontinuity and strip
               development, the lower is the Moran coefficient.",

  abstract  = "Problem: Localities and states are turning to land planning and
               urban design for help in reducing automobile use and related
               social and environmental costs. The effects of such strategies on
               travel demand have not been generalized in recent years from the
               multitude of available studies. Purpose: We conducted a
               meta-analysis of the built environment-travel literature existing
               at the end of 2009 in order to draw generalizable conclusions for
               practice. We aimed to quantify effect sizes, update earlier work,
               include additional outcome measures, and address the
               methodological issue of self-selection. Methods: We computed
               elasticities for individual studies and pooled them to produce
               weighted averages. Results and conclusions: Travel variables are
               generally inelastic with respect to change in measures of the
               built environment. Of the environmental variables considered
               here, none has a weighted average travel elasticity of absolute
               magnitude greater than 0.39, and most are much less. Still, the
               combined effect of several such variables on travel could be
               quite large. Consistent with prior work, we find that vehicle
               miles traveled (VMT) is most strongly related to measures of
               accessibility to destinations and secondarily to street network
               design variables. Walking is most strongly related to measures of
               land use diversity, intersection density, and the number of
               destinations within walking distance. Bus and train use are
               equally related to proximity to transit and street network design
               variables, with land use diversity a secondary factor.
               Surprisingly, we find population and job densities to be only
               weakly associated with travel behavior once these other variables
               are controlled. Takeaway for practice: The elasticities we
               derived in this meta-analysis may be used to adjust outputs of
               travel or activity models that are otherwise insensitive to
               variation in the built environment, or be used in sketch planning
               applications ranging from climate action plans to health impact
               assessments. However, because sample sizes are small, and very
               few studies control for residential preferences and attitudes, we
               cannot say that planners should generalize broadly from our
               results. While these elasticities are as accurate as currently
               possible, they should be understood to contain unknown error and
               have unknown confidence intervals. They provide a base, and as
               more built-environment/travel studies appear in the planning
               literature, these elasticities should be updated and refined.

              professionals need to make use of theory-like propositions linking
              the two domains. In the absence of scientifically tested
              propositions, a shifting consensus of beliefs fills the need, and
              it can take decades of social costs to show the inadequacy of
              these beliefs. The problem of social theory and the built
              environment is then defined for the purposes of this paper in
              terms of the potential for testable propositions at the level at
              which one intervenes in the built environment. This is called the
              need for 'design-level' theories, defining design in the broad
              sense of all the choices and decisions made by built environment
              professionals in creating and modifying the built environment.
              Examining social theory under two broad headings, 'urban
              sociology' and 'society and space', it is noted that both approach
              the society-environment relation 'society first', in that the form
              of the environment is sought as the product of the spatial
              dimensions of social processes. This is called the 'spatiality'
              paradigm, and note that such approaches have never reached, and
              probably can never reach, the level of precision about the built
              environment which would be needed to found testable propositions
              at the design level. The alternative is to turn the question the
              other way round and through 'environment first' studies look for
              evidence of social processes in the spatial forms of the built
              environment. Recent work of this kind is outlined within the
              'space syntax' paradigm and it is shown how the greater

              professionals need to make use of theory-like propositions linking
              the two domains. In the absence of scientifically tested
              propositions, a shifting consensus of beliefs fills the need, and
              it can take decades of social costs to show the inadequacy of
              these beliefs. The problem of social theory and the built
              environment is then defined for the purposes of this paper in
              terms of the potential for testable propositions at the level at
              which one intervenes in the built environment. This is called the
              need for 'design-level' theories, defining design in the broad
              sense of all the choices and decisions made by built environment
              professionals in creating and modifying the built environment.
              Examining social theory under two broad headings, 'urban
              sociology' and 'society and space', it is noted that both approach
              the society-environment relation 'society first', in that the form
              of the environment is sought as the product of the spatial
              dimensions of social processes. This is called the 'spatiality'
              paradigm, and note that such approaches have never reached, and
              probably can never reach, the level of precision about the built
              environment which would be needed to found testable propositions
              at the design level. The alternative is to turn the question the
              other way round and through 'environment first' studies look for
              evidence of social processes in the spatial forms of the built
              environment. Recent work of this kind is outlined within the
              'space syntax' paradigm and it is shown how the greater
              descriptive precision this brings to the built environment both
              permits linkages to mainline formulations in social theory and

               storing and further analysing the results of multiple viewshed

               visual properties based on graph metrics-in particular,
               neighbourhood clustering coefficient and path length analysis.
               These analyses suggest that measures derived from the visibility

               perception concerning the built environmental characteristics can
               assist in designing a safer built environment in an urban area in
               Mexico. METHODS: The study involved two stages of data
               collection. In the first stage, a physical audit on selected
               urban roads was performed to assess the characteristics that may
               increase the perceived risk of a collision. An observational
               framework to evaluate the crossing areas, sidewalks and
               organizational factors was developed and used for data
               collection. In the second stage, an on-street questionnaire was
               applied to collect the perception of a group of 299 pedestrians
               about safety risks, road characteristics and their ideas for
               designing a safer built environment. RESULTS: The physical road
               audit identified several features in the crossing areas and
               sidewalks, such as parked cars, movable and fixed obstacles, and
               lack of traffic signage, which may increase the risk of a
               pedestrian being involved in a collision. More than half of the
               road users who were interviewed either agree (27\%) or strongly
               agree (29\%) with the statement that crossing the roads in the
               area was safe. However, pedestrians also identified the following
               elements as detrimental for the safe use of roads: lack of
               traffic lights, too much traffic, lack of signs, and parked cars
               that obstruct visibility. Participants also raised issues beyond
               the physical infrastructure; for instance, a lack of respect
               shown by drivers to pedestrians. For designing a safer built
               environment, participants suggested several ideas highlighting
               pedestrianization of the road and widening the sidewalks, along
               with restricting parking of cars on the road. CONCLUSIONS: This
               combination of findings provide valuable support for the premise
               that pedestrians may have a good sense of recognizing safety
               problems and the ability to see the solutions. Although the
               research was undertaken in the context of a municipality in
               Guadalajara, the role of pedestrian safety perception may be
               applicable in other urban settings in low and middle-income
               countries (LMICs), where local authorities are in charge of
               designing the road environment. This study highlights the
               relevance of including pedestrians' participation for a safer and
               human-centred design of our cities.",

               built environments and public safety. Acknowledging the
               perception of pedestrians, specifically their psychological and
               emotional reactions toward certain public space settings would be
               another effective parameter to develop a good foundation to
               create more livable and safer neighborhoods. With these in mind,
               the analyses in this study have attempted to explore the
               relationship between street conditions and the perception of
               pedestrian safety in Auburn Alabama, USA. The research design
               primarily consists of an online survey that obtained information
               about (1) respondents? brief personal characteristics, (2) their
               walking times, (3) their levels of anxiety regarding certain
               street settings based on daytime and nighttime photographs
               (closed-ended questions on a Likert scale from 1 to 5), and (4)
               their reasoning behind these ratings (open-ended). The results
               show that proper street lighting is the main contributor to
               enhancing the feeling of safety on streets followed by the
               morphologic complexity of streets formed by various business
               types, outdoor dining, street performers, and other pedestrian
               activities. Other than physical settings, the study also found

               processions and crowd activities in the English industrial city
               of Sheffield c.1790?1910. It identifies a theoretical weakness in
               the historical scholarship where an emphasis on the role of
               procession and protest in symbolically ordering the built
               environment too often serves to represent it as intrinsically
               un-ordered and lacking in definition. The effect, it is argued,
               has been to present symbolic regimes, particularly those of local
               elites, as something imposed on rather than in any sense arising
               from quotidian urban performance, and artificially to isolate
               research into processional and other mass participation
               activities from the shared material context of a city?s spatial
               culture. The notion of spatial culture is developed with
               reference to the work of Bill Hillier, Manuel De Landa, and Henri
               Lefebvre, among others, to propose an interpretative ?mapping? of
               the relationship between the evolving structure of Sheffield?s
               built form and the development of its processional culture. The
               research raises the question of how far civic traditions often

               conditions of urban life itself, in that sense revealing the

               economic structure, surface transportation, community design, and
               urban design. It then reviews quantitative measures in each
               class. Based on the review, four conclusions are drawn. First,
               over the last two decades substantial progress has been made in
               the ability to measure and analyze spatial patterns that help
               characterize urban form. Second, at multiples scales and for a
               variety of reasons, there are advantages to development that is
               mixed and compact. Third, normative principles and policies for
               addressing urban form need to be crafted at multiple scales and
               carefully designed to address the disparate issues that arise at
               each scale. Fourth, with so many disparate measures now used to
               operationalize the same constructs, it would advance urban form
               research to have some standardization in operational definitions

               space. Man's sense of space is a synthesis of many sensory
               inputs: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, and thermal.
               Not only does each of these constitute a complex system (as for
               example, the dozen or more different ways of experiencing depth
               visually), but each is molded and patterned by culture. Hence
               people reared in different cultures live in different sensory
               worlds. What is more, they are generally unaware of the degree to
               which the worlds may differ. From the study of culture we learn
               that the patterning of perceptual worlds is a function not only
               of the specific culture but of the relationship, activity, and
               emotions present in a given situation. Therefore, when two people
               of different cultures interact, each uses different criteria to
               interpret the other's behavior, and each may easily misinterpret
               the relationship, the activity, or the emotions involved. The
               study of culture in the proxemic sense is the study of peoples'
               use of their perceptual apparatus in different emotional states
               during different activities, in different relationships,
               settings, and contexts. No single research technique is
               sufficient in scope to investigate this complex,
               multi-dimensional subject. The research technique is, therefore,
               a function of the particular facet under examination at the time
               and many call for the involvement of many disciplines. Like all
               basic studies of the communicative process, proxemics, as I think
               of it, is more concerned with how than why, and more concerned
               with structure than content. The work is admittedly detailed and
               is apt to be routine. It addresses itself to basic human
               situations in an area of culture that is ordinarily hidden from
               conscious awareness. For this reason, proxemics frequently leads
               to new insights about specific cultures, as well as to insights
               into the generalized concept of culture itself. In formulating my
               thinking concerning proxemics, I have maintained that culture is
               an extension of basic biological processes. While man's
               extensions as they evolve may mask the underlying relationships
               which maintain the equilibrium of biological systems, the
               relationships and systems are no less real by virtue of being
               hidden. In the words of Ian McHarg (1963): ...no species can
               exist without an environment, no species can exist in an
               environment of its exclusive creation, no species can survive,
               save as a nondisruptive member of an ecological community. Every
               member must adjust to other members of the community and to the
               environment in order to survive. Man is not excluded from this
               test.",

               have proposed that many of these urban measures can be predicted

               consistently define cities, using commuting to work and

               realizations of systems of cities with different boundaries for

               analysis of a large set of urban indicators. The analysis shows
               that population size alone does not provide us enough information

               proposed, indicating that the expected scaling laws are not

               with city size, regardless of the definition of the urban
               boundaries. However, when nonlinear correlations are present, the
               exponent fluctuates considerably.",

               underway dealing with pedestrian safety and collision avoidance.
               The importance of pedestrian protection is emphasized in a global
               context, discussing the research programs and efforts in various
               countries. Pedestrian safety measures, including infrastructure
               enhancements and passive safety features in vehicles, are
               described, followed by a systematic description of active safety
               systems based on pedestrian detection using sensors in vehicle
               and infrastructure. The pedestrian detection approaches are
               classified according to various criteria such as the type and
               configuration of sensors, as well as the video cues and
               classifiers used in detection algorithms. It is noted that
               collision avoidance not only requires detection of pedestrians
               but also requires collision prediction using pedestrian dynamics
               and behavior analysis. Hence, this paper includes research
               dealing with probabilistic modeling of pedestrian behavior for

               and substance of urban theory. The debate has been marked by many
               different claims about the nature of cities, including
               declarations that the urban is an incoherent concept, that urban
               society is nothing less than modern society as a whole, that the
               urban scale can no longer be separated from the global scale, and
               that urban theory hitherto has been deeply vitiated by its almost
               exclusive concentration on the cities of the global North. This
               article offers some points of clarification of claims like these.
               All cities can be understood in terms of a theoretical framework
               that combines two main processes, namely, the dynamics of
               agglomeration/polarization, and the unfolding of an associated
               nexus of locations, land uses and human interactions. This same
               framework can be used to identify many different varieties of
               cities, and to distinguish intrinsically urban phenomena from the
               rest of social reality. The discussion thus identifies the common
               dimensions of all cities without, on the one hand, exaggerating
               the scope of urban theory, or on the other hand, asserting that
               every individual city is an irreducible special case.",

               16 years old (mean age 43.5 years, SD = 6.8, 34.8\% non-White,
               63.8\% overweight) completed NEWS and the International Physical
               Activity Questionnaire. GIS was used to develop 1-mile street
               network buffers around participants' residences. GIS measures of
               the built environment within participants' buffers included
               percent of commercial and institutional land uses; number of
               schools and colleges, recreational facilities, parks, transit
               stops, and trees; land topography; and traffic congestion.
               RESULTS: Except for trees and traffic, concordance between the
               NEWS and GIS measures were significant, with weak to moderate
               effect sizes (r = -0.09 to -0.36, all P < or = 01). After
               participants were stratified by physical activity level, stronger
               concordance was observed among active participants for some
               measures. A sensitivity analysis of self-reported distance to 15
               neighborhood destinations found a 20-minute (compared with 10- or
               30-minute) walking threshold generally had the strongest
               correlations with GIS measures. CONCLUSIONS: These findings
               provide evidence of the concurrent validity of self-reported
               built environment items with objective measures. Physically

              operational functioning and planning through management, control
              and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a
              laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban

              state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We
              define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as
              smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the
              development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused
              on high technologies, the development of urban services using
              contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence
              functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of
              participation. Seven project areas are then proposed: Integrated
              Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the Impact
              of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and
              Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic
              Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour
              and Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence,
              Participatory Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart
              City. Finally we anticipate the paradigm shifts that will occur in
              this research and define a series of key demonstrators which we
              believe are important to progressing a science of smart cities.",

              perception and response to the surrounding urban en-vironment. For
              example, the visual qualities of urban spaces affect the
              psychological states of their inhabitants and can induce negative
              social outcomes. Hence, it becomes criti-cally important to
              understand people's perceptions and eval-uations of urban spaces.
              Previous works have demonstrated that algorithms can be used to
              predict high level attributes of urban scenes (e.g. safety,
              attractiveness, uniqueness), ac-curately emulating human
              perception. In this paper we pro-pose a novel approach for
              predicting the perceived safety of a scene from Google Street View
              Images. Opposite to previous works, we formulate the problem of
              learning to predict high level judgments as a ranking task and we
              em-ploy a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), significantly
              improving the accuracy of predictions over previous meth-ods.
              Interestingly, the proposed CNN architecture relies on a novel
              pooling layer, which permits to automatically dis-cover the most
              important areas of the images for predicting the concept of
              perceived safety. An extensive experimental evaluation, conducted
              on the publicly available Place Pulse dataset, demonstrates the

               spherical coordinate system were adopted as the basic units for
               visibility levels. Starting from the space prototype, the

               with the visual effects in open spaces, including the openness,
               enclosure and ground coverage for edge; the distribution and

              been dramatically transformed in the last four decades by the

              models simulate urban land use changes which evolve from the
              bottom-up. Despite notable achievements in this field, there
              remain significant gaps between urban processes simulated in CA
              models and the actual dynamics of evolving urban systems. This
              article identifies contemporary issues faced in developing urban
              CA models and draws on this evidence to map out four interrelated
              thematic areas that require concerted attention by the wider CA
              urban modelling community. These are: (1) to build models that
              comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional processes of urban
              change, including urban regeneration, densification and
              gentrification, in-fill development, as well as urban shrinkage
              and vertical urban growth; (2) to establish models that
              incorporate individual human decision behaviours into the CA
              analytic framework; (3) to draw on emergent sources of ‘big data’
              to calibrate and validate urban CA models and to capture the role
              of human actors and their impact on urban change dynamics; and (4)
              to strengthen theory-based CA models that comprehensively explain
              urban change mechanisms and dynamics. We conclude by advocating
              cellular automata that embed agent-based models and big data input

               the EU?s self-image as a normative power, changing political
               situations in the region and the Realpolitik of security. We
               argue that this also involved a ?politics of in/visibility? that
               promotes democratization and social modernization through
               structured cooperation while engaging selectively with local
               stakeholders. In directing attention to EU readings of and
               responses to the ?Arab Spring?, we indicate how both a
               simplification of the issues at stake and highly selective
               political framings of local civil societies have operated in
               tandem. Drawing on a review of recent literature on civil society
               activism in the southern Mediterranean, we specifically deal with
               Eurocentric appropriations of civil society as a force for change

               Neighbourhood. EU support for South Mediterranean civil society
               appears to be targeted at specific actors with whom the EU deems
               it can work: apart from national elites these include
               well-established, professionalized non-governmental

               societies. As a result, recognition of the heterogeneous and

               map. In this study, we assessed wayfinding and cognitive
               performances of 31 participants in a multilevel shopping mall
               with five atriums which provided adequate visual access and
               smooth floor transitions. (1) In the wayfinding task, we observed
               path choice for 31 participants in this mall. The participants?
               choice for all path segments, also vertical path segments,
               clearly gravitated toward the most accessible spaces in the whole
               building, rather than most accessible space within individual
               floors. (2) Participants were also asked to identify the
               locations where they can see maximum number of stores. The
               identified locations can be reliably predicted by objectively
               measured three-dimensional visibility information, but not

               impact of urban form on fundamental natural and social patterns
               (equity, prosperity and resource consumption?s efficiency) is now
               fully acknowledged. However, urban morphology is still far from
               offering a comprehensive and reliable framework for quantitative
               analysis. Despite remarkable progress since its emergence in the
               late 1950s, the discipline still exhibits significant
               terminological inconsistencies with regards to the definition of
               the fundamental components of urban form, which prevents the
               establishment of objective models for measuring it. In this
               article, we present a study of existing methods for measuring
               urban form, with a focus on terminological inconsistencies, and
               propose a systematic and comprehensive framework to classify
               urban form characters, where ?urban form character? stands for a
               characteristic (or feature) of one kind of urban form that
               distinguishes it from another kind. In particular, we introduce
               the Index of Elements that allows for a univocal and
               non-interpretive description of urban form characters. Based on
               such Index of Elements, we develop a systematic classification of
               urban form according to six categories (dimension, shape, spatial
               distribution, intensity, connectivity and diversity) and three
               conceptual scales (small, medium, large) based on two definitions
               of scale (extent and grain). This framework is then applied to
               identify and organise the urban form characters adopted in
               available literature to date. The resulting classification of
               urban form characters reveals clear gaps in existing research, in
               particular, in relation to the spatial distribution and diversity
               characters. The proposed framework reduces the current
               inconsistencies of urban morphology research, paving the way to
               enhanced methods of urban form systematic and quantitative
               analysis at a global scale.",

              evolving, reflecting changing human needs and local contingencies,
              manifested in space by many urban patterns. Urban Morphology laid
              the foundation for understanding many such patterns, largely
              relying on qualitative research methods to extract distinct
              spatial identities of urban areas. However, the manual,
              labour-intensive and subjective nature of such approaches
              represents an impediment to the development of a scalable,
              replicable and data-driven urban form characterisation. Recently,
              with advances in Geographic Data Science and the growing
              availability of digital mapping products, researchers in this
              field have developed an interest in quantitative urban morphology,
              or urban morphometrics, with the potential to overcome such
              limitations. In this paper, we present a method for numerical
              taxonomy of urban form derived from biological systematics, which
              allows the rigorous detection and classification of urban types.
              Initially, we produce a rich numerical characterisation of urban
              space from minimal data input, minimizing limitations due to
              inconsistent data quality and availability. These are street
              network, building footprint, and morphological tessellation, a
              spatial unit derivative of Voronoi tessellation, obtained from
              building footprints. Hence, we derive homogeneous urban tissue
              types (or taxa) and, by determining overall morphological
              similarity between them, generate a hierarchical classification
              (phenetic taxonomy) of urban form. After framing and presenting
              the method, we test it on two cities - Prague and Amsterdam - and

               walkability that transcends the boundaries of historical cities.
               These factors, while initially identified within historical
               contexts, possess inherent qualities that render them universally
               adaptable to various urban landscapes. By leveraging these
               factors, urban planners gain insights into the intricate fabric
               of pedestrian experiences in cities. They serve as universal
               evaluative tools, applicable not only to historical cities but
               also to burgeoning metropolises and smaller urban centres. This
               work introduces a novel approach to assessing the Walkability

              housing conditions of the slums of Enugu metropolis and the public
              health implications. METHODS: This is a community-based
              cross-sectional study of 459 slum residents of the Enugu
              metropolis. Ethical clearance was obtained from the UNTH, Health
              Research Ethics Committee (HREC). Data was collected using a
              pretested semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaire
              and an observational checklist. Data was analysed using IBM SPSS
              version 23. Data were summarised using mean and standard
              deviation, frequency and proportion as appropriate and presented
              in tables and figures. The chi-square test was used for
              association at p-value ≤ 0.05 significance. RESULTS: The mean age
              (SD) of the respondents was 32.93(12.34) years. A higher
              proportion (N = 180, 39.2\%) were 18-27years, females (N = 282,
              61.4\%), married (N = 297, 64.7\%), attained secondary education

              327, 71.2\%). They demonstrated good knowledge of standard housing
              specifications (N = 231, 50.3\%) and the effects of housing
              conditions on health (N = 297, 64.7\%). Also, most lived in a
              one-room apartment (N = 201, 43.8\%) and cooked in a separate
              kitchen (N = 150, 32.7\%) with a gas cooker as the major source of
              heat supply for cooking (N = 249, 54.2\%). Sixty-three (13.7\%) of
              the respondents didn't have access to suitable toilet facilities.
              A higher proportion, (N = 171, 37.3\%) used pipe-borne water, and
              electricity as the major source of light (N = 447, 97.4\%). The
              most prevailing health condition was malaria/fever (N = 258,
              97.4\%). Despite having pests and rodents-infested dwellings, only
              (N = 156, 34.0\%) had insecticides in the house. Equally, (N =
              132, 28.8\%) of them lived with broken floors. CONCLUSIONS:
              Despite good knowledge of the public health implications of poor
              housing, most dwellings remained substandard and unhealthful with
              associated prevalent health conditions. RECOMMENDATION: There is a

               physical activity (PA) in older adults is needed to develop
               effective health promotion initiatives. However, research in this
               age group is scarce and most existing studies were conducted in
               North America. The present study aimed to examine relationships
               between GIS-based neighborhood walkability and objective and
               self-reported PA in community-dwelling Belgian older adults.
               Furthermore, moderating effects of neighborhood income levels
               were investigated. METHODS: The Belgian Environmental Physical
               Activity Study (BEPAS) for Seniors is a cross-sectional study in
               older adults (≥65 yrs) and was conducted between October 2010 and
               September 2012. Data from 438 older adults living in 20
               neighborhoods across Ghent (Belgium) were analyzed.
               Stratification of selected neighborhoods was based upon objective
               walkability and neighborhood income. Participants wore an
               accelerometer during seven consecutive days to obtain objective
               levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).
               Self-reported levels of transportation walking/cycling and
               recreational walking/cycling were assessed using the
               International Physical Activity Questionnaire (long, last 7 days
               version) adapted for the elderly. Multi-level regression analyses
               were conducted. RESULTS: Findings showed a positive relationship
               between neighborhood walkability and weekly minutes of older
               adults' self-reported walking for transportation (B = 4.63 ±
               1.05;p < 0.001) and a negative relationship between walkability
               and accelerometer-derived low-light PA (B = -1.38 ± 0.62;p =
               0.025). Walkability was not related to any measure of
               recreational PA. A walkability x income interaction was found for
               accelerometer-derived MVPA (B = -1.826 ± 1.03;p = 0.075), showing
               only a positive association between walkability and MVPA in
               low-income neighborhood residents. CONCLUSIONS: This was the
               first European study to examine walkability-PA relationships in
               older adults. These Belgian findings suggest that a high
               neighborhood walkability relates to higher levels of older
               adults' transport-related walking. As transport-related walking
               is an accessible activity for older adults and easy to integrate
               in their daily routine, policy makers and health promoters are
               advised to provide sufficient destinations and
               pedestrian-friendly facilities in the close vicinity of older
               adults' residences, so short trips can be made by foot.
               Neighborhood income moderated the relationship between
               walkability and objectively-measured MVPA. Increasing total MVPA
               levels in older adults should be a key topic in development of
               promotion initiatives and special attention should be paid to
               low-income neighborhood residents.",

               colonial era, exhibit unique urban morphological characteristics
               and reflect the planning ideologies of diverse cultures. Thus,
               the morphological study of colonial cities in Asia and Africa is
               crucial for understanding and identifying the historical and
               cultural value of these cities, which in turn enables the
               formulation of precise conservation strategies. In light of this,
               the study develops an urban morphological analysis methodology
               comprising ``Colonial Background Analysis—Morphological
               Characteristics Analysis—Driving Factor Extraction'' based on the
               Conzenian Approach, which is used to examine the morphology of 21
               typical colonial cities in Asia and Africa across various
               colonial periods. As a result, ``Dual-City'' emerges as the core
               spatial characteristic of colonial cities in Asia and Africa,
               reflecting the morphological differences in road layouts, urban
               fabric, and urban cores between native and European zones.
               Additionally, as native settlement sizes, social structures, and
               cultural identities differ between cities, three major spatial
               patterns of the ``Dual-City'' model can be identified: separated,
               mediated, and integrated spatial patterns, resulting from the
               varied planning approaches applied by colonizers. Furthermore,
               suggestions for the conservation of colonial heritage are
               proposed based on the driving factors analysis from the

               and well-being has long been a topic of scientific and public
               health policy discussion, but the links remain elusive. Here we
               explore the role of the residential environment in the etiology
               of illness (specifically asthma) and the persistence of
               socioeconomic health disparities. Housing conditions, shaped by
               social forces, affect exposure to physical and chemical
               ``toxicants,'' thereby translating social adversities into
               individual illness and population health disparities. We discuss
               the mediating role of housing in determining health outcomes at
               multiple levels (social-structural, neighborhood, and individual
               family). To date, little attention has been paid by most
               environmental health scientists to the social-structural
               conditions underlying gross inequities in the distribution of
               toxic exposures, with even less attention to the processes
               whereby these social conditions may directly affect
               susceptibility to the toxic exposures themselves. This chapter
               goes beyond traditional medical and environmental science models
               to incorporate a range of social and physical determinants of
               environmental pollutions, illustrating how these conditions
               result in health and illness. We focus here on childhood asthma
               as an example of a serious public health problem that has been
               associated with low income, minority status, and characteristics
               of the home environment. We end the chapter with a discussion of
               the environmental justice movement and the role of housing as a
               potential agent of change and focus of interventions aimed to
               reduce the harmful effects of environmental pollutants.",

               METHODS: A stratified two-stage cluster sample design was used to
               recruit 1286 adults. The sample was drawn from residential
               addresses within eight high- and eight low-walkable neighborhoods
               matched for socioeconomic status. Subjects completed the NEWS and
               reported weekly minutes of walking for transport and recreation
               using items from the International Physical Activity
               Questionnaire. RESULTS: Multilevel confirmatory factor analysis
               was used to develop measurement models of the NEWS and NEWS-A.
               Six individual-level and five blockgroup-level factors were
               identified. Factors/scales gauging presence of diversity of
               destinations, residential density, walking infrastructure,
               aesthetics, traffic safety, and crime were positively related to
               walking for transport. Aesthetics, mixed destinations, and
               residential density were associated with walking for recreation.
               CONCLUSIONS: The NEWS and NEWS-A possess adequate levels of
               factorial and criterion validity. Alternative methods of scoring
               for different purposes are presented.",

              to learn that these cities are unequal; she can see it directly
              from the taxicab window. This is because in most cities inequality
              is conspicuous, but also, because cities express different forms
              of inequality that are evident to casual observers. Cities are
              highly heterogeneous and often unequal with respect to the income
              of their residents, but also with respect to the cleanliness of
              their neighborhoods, the beauty of their architecture, and the
              liveliness of their streets, among many other evaluative
              dimensions. Until now, however, our ability to understand the
              effect of a city's built environment on social and economic
              outcomes has been limited by the lack of quantitative data on
              urban perception. Here, we build on the intuition that inequality
              is partly conspicuous to create quantitative measure of a city's
              contrasts. Using thousands of geo-tagged images, we measure the
              perception of safety, class and uniqueness; in the cities of
              Boston and New York in the United States, and Linz and Salzburg in
              Austria, finding that the range of perceptions elicited by the
              images of New York and Boston is larger than the range of
              perceptions elicited by images from Linz and Salzburg. We
              interpret this as evidence that the cityscapes of Boston and New
              York are more contrasting, or unequal, than those of Linz and
              Salzburg. Finally, we validate our measures by exploring the
              connection between them and homicides, finding a significant
              correlation between the perceptions of safety and class and the
              number of homicides in a NYC zip code, after controlling for the
              effects of income, population, area and age. Our results show that
              online images can be used to create reproducible quantitative
              measures of urban perception and characterize the inequality of
              different cities. © 2013 Salesses et al.",

               scripted acts, movements, and rhythms. Unlike anthropologists in
               the field, scholars of the medieval and early modern world cannot
               witness ceremonies - the processions, dramas, rituals, and
               liturgies - and their choreography, or how they engaged with time
               and space. Denied the possibility of personal observation, how
               are historians to understand ceremonies such as a Catholic
               liturgical procession moving through a medieval town or the
               triumphal entry of a Renaissance ruler into a subjected city?
               Fortunately, considerable documentary, visual, and material
               evidence survives from Europe to help scholars frame necessary
               questions about pre-modern ceremonies. The essayists in this
               volume identify and recover the excitement and dynamism that
               characterized ceremonial culture in pre-modern Europe. Each turns
               to key issues: the relation between public and private space, the
               development of fully-realized dramas and rituals from earlier
               forms, and the semiotic code that ceremonies manifested to their
               audiences. Their subjects include the Adventus procession at
               Chartres; Epiphany and Palm Sunday rituals in medieval Moscow;
               the staged entry of the future Emperor Charles V into Bruges in
               1515; and ceremonies in Italian Renaissance cities interpreted
               through the lens of Renaissance optical theory. What emerges from
               each essay is a deeper understanding that any ceremony is,
               finally, an attempt to close the divide between abstract and
               literal, ideal and actual.",

               suburban town of Watford--are examined for the period since the
               First World War. Evidence is revealed of the tendency for
               architects to be based in the same towns as initiators of plans,
               and for consultants, builders and civil engineering contractors,
               and specialized contractors to be more closely related in their
               locations to these two agents of change than to one another.
               Consultants tend to have locations in south-east England,
               builders and civil engineering contractors are generally located
               in the vicinity of their building activities, and specialized
               contractors are the least inter-connected with other types of
               firms and the most widely dispersed geographically. The influx of
               outside firms has been much less restricted to London-based
               concerns in central Northampton than it has in central Watford.
               Despite the fact that the main phase of investment by the
               national retail and service chains was earlier in Northampton,
               the decline of local firms there was delayed relative to Watford.

               place. This has led to much research implicitly accepting a
               restrictive Cartesian view of socio-spatial reality. Entrikin's
               (1991) 'betweenness of place' thesis is a notable recent
               illustration. In this paper I suggest that the problematic nature
               of place and its relationship to space can be resolved through a
               dialectical mode of argumentation. The spatialized dialectic of
               Henri Lefebvre offers a fruitful framework for reconciling the
               interaction between place and space insofar as it strives to
               overcome dualistic conceptions of capitalist spatiality.
               Lefevbre's dialectical approach will be counterposed to
               Entrikin's argument. The paper concludes by outlining the

               risks for the preservation of liveability (e.g. residential
               function) in formerly prosperous historical residential and
               industrial districts. The planning for shrinkage emerged only in
               the 21st century in order to manage and prevent growing urban
               decay, depopulation and housing crisis through the application of
               smart structural adjustment policies and planning instruments for
               formerly heavily industrialised North American and Asian cities.
               Both shrinkage and liveability planning are still very “fuzzy”
               concepts and have been applied in ways that are not always
               consistent (e.g. for measuring decline, migration, demographics).
               However, remains the question of what (methods or approaches)
               would prevent (control) this well-known but evidently “wicked”
               and still less explored phenomenon of “loss of liveability” in a
               historical built environment. This paper aims to review the urban
               shrinkage and liveability problematic and prevention solutions

               and Taylor to the often neglected contributions of German
               scholars. The ambiguous relationship between anthropology and

               distinctive national styles in anthropological research is
               highlighted. A History of Anthropology is an unparalleled account
               of theoretical developments in anthropology from the 1920s to the
               present, including functionalism, structuralism, hermeneutics,
               neo-Marxism and discourse analysis. Major anthropologists are

  abstract = "Circuity, the ratio of network distances to straight-line
              distances, is an important measure of urban street network
              structure and transportation efficiency. Circuity results from a
              circulation network's configuration, planning, and underlying
              terrain. In turn, it impacts how humans use urban space for
              settlement and travel. Although past research has examined overall
              street network circuity, researchers have not studied the relative
              circuity of walkable versus drivable circulation networks. This
              study uses OpenStreetMap data to explore relative network
              circuity. We download walkable and drivable networks for 40 US
              cities using the OSMnx software, which we then use to simulate
              four million routes and analyze circuity to characterize network
              structure. We find that walking networks tend to allow for more
              direct routes than driving networks do in most cities: average
              driving circuity exceeds average walking circuity in all but four
              of the cities that exhibit statistically significant differences
              between network types. We discuss various reasons for this
              phenomenon, illustrated with case studies. Network circuity also
              varies substantially between different types of places. These
              findings underscore the value of using network-based distances and
              times rather than straight-line when studying urban travel and
              access. They also suggest the importance of differentiating
              between walkable and drivable circulation networks when modeling
              and characterizing urban street networks: although different
              modes' networks overlap in any given city, their relative
              structure and performance vary in most cities.",

               socioeconomic activities conducted in the urban spaces of
               historic cities. The current urban interventions and intrusions
               have fashioned new developments in and outside the historic core
               of Lahore. Chowk Wazir Khan, situated in the Walled City of
               Lahore, contains intricate Mughal architectural elements and
               remains a versatile public space that serves as a center of
               cultural and economic activities. This study is focused on the
               priorities of urban transformations during the revitalization,
               regeneration, and reconstruction projects implemented in view of
               preserving the socioeconomic sustainability of the aforementioned
               heritage site. The interventions like conscious transportation,
               landuse, street scape etc have a great impact on the built
               environment, also affect the continuance of the traditional roles
               within historic environment. The main aim is to explore these
               socioeconomic variables within the historic setting and their
               impacts on the heritage site. The study also aims to draw the
               indicators which generate pressures on the historic city. The
               current research would help to discover the complex economic and
               technological processes enacting urban change in order to balance
               social activities, support the future of the historic center, and
               contribute towards social sustainability. To conclude, urban
               transformations in historic cities such as the Walled City of
               Lahore must be planned and centered to its historic urban fabric.
               Furthermore, public urban spaces should be intended and organized

              defining the eligibility criteria, we proceeded to the screening
              process concluded with the inclusion of 19 studies. The analysis
              of the contributions led to the systematization of six main urban
              topics-and to the corresponding spatial requirements and project
              proposals-highlighted as relevant and supportive in terms of the

              advances achieved over the last decades changing the paradigm from
              historical monuments to urban landscapes, the focus tends to be on
              the building fabric and the main three-dimensional characteristics
              of buildings. This paper proposes a complementary emphasis for
              conservation—the town-plan, meaning the different patterns of
              combination of streets, plots, and block-plans of buildings
              (building footprints). Preserving the town-plan of urban areas
              built in the past, means bringing to the present signiﬁcant parts
              of urban history, assuring diversity (a key characteristic for
              sustainable, resilient, and safe cities), and providing a basis
              for the design of new areas more accessible, dense, and
              continuous. This argument is illustrated in the Chelsea district
              in New York at two different scales.",

               third way is necessary to integrate mass-production, heritage,
               and human values. As part of UNICITI’s initiative, A Third Way of
               Building Asian Cities, we propose a scalable and replicable
               methodology which captures unique morphological traits of urban
               types (i.e., areas with homogenous urban form) to inform
               innovative large-scale and context-sensitive practices. We
               extract urban types from a large set of quantitative descriptors
               and provide a systematic way to generate figure-grounds aligned
               with such urban types. The application of the proposed
               methodology to Kochi (IN) reveals 24 distinct urban types with
               unique morphological features. Profiles, containing
               design-relevant values of morphometrics, are then produced for a

               seem aligned with the urban character of their respective types,

               land expansion in Baishan, deepening the incongruity between the
               city’s population and construction land. (3) The smart shrinkage

               land, which would push the city in the direction of healthy and

               data availability and data update cycle, and this problem is more
               serious when making an assessment at finer spatial scales (e.g.,
               community level). Here we aim to develop a reliable and dynamic
               model for community-level livability assessment taking Linyi city
               in Shandong Province, China as a case study. First, we
               constructed a hierarchical index system for livability
               assessment, and derived data for each index and community from
               remotely sensed data or Internet-based geospatial data. Next, we
               calculated the livability scores for all communities and assessed
               their uncertainties using Monte Carlo simulations. The results
               showed that the mean livability score of all communities was 59.
               The old urban and newly developed districts of our study area had
               the best livability, and got a livability score of 62 and 58
               respectively, while industrial districts had the poorest
               conditions with an average livability score of 48. Results by
               dimension showed that the old urban district had better
               conditions of living amenity and travel convenience, but poorer
               conditions of environmental health and comfort. The newly
               developed districts were the opposite. We conclude that our model
               is effective and extendible for rapidly assessing community-level

               transition, India represents an ideal context to develop and test
               approaches for the detection of features related to urbanization.
               We perform the analysis in Google Earth Engine (GEE) using three
               types of classifiers, based on imagery from Landsat 7 and Landsat
               8 as inputs. The methodology produces high-quality maps of
               built-up areas across space and time. Although the dataset can
               facilitate supervised image classification in any platform, we
               highlight its potential use in GEE for temporal large-scale
               analysis of the urbanization process. Our methodology can easily
               be applied to other countries and regions.",

               syntax theory building within two key research traditions:
               positivism and hermeneutics. Applying a theory of science
               perspective, we first discuss the explanatory power of space
               syntax and its applications. Next, we distinguish between
               theories that attempt to explain a phenomenon and theories that
               seek to understand it, based on Von Wright’s modal logics and
               Bhaskar’s critical realism models. We demonstrate that space
               syntax research that focuses on spatial configurative changes in
               built environments, movement and economic activities can explain
               changes in a built environment in terms of cause and effect
               (positivism), whereas historical research or research focusing on
               social rationality, space and crime or cognition seeks to develop
               an understanding of the inherent cultural meaning of the space
               under investigation (hermeneutics). Evidently, the effect of
               human intentions and behaviour on spatial structures depends on
               the type of rationality underlying these intentions, which is the
               focus of this study. Positivist explanatory models are
               appropriate for examining market rationality in cases that entail
               unambiguous intentionality and that are associated with a high
               degree of predictability. By contrast, other kinds of reasoning

               around the world. The global population has continued to increase
               steadily and, according to forecasts, the trend will be
               maintained in the coming decades. An increase in the 60+
               population is yet another important demographic change. These
               determinants pose new challenges for socio-economic, spatial, and
               transport policies in most, if not all, cities in the world.
               These policies should be aligned with the global development
               paradigm to promote sustainable development and sustainable
               improvement of the quality of life of the present and future
               generations. In the coming years, the potential of cities should
               be recognized, resources should be managed rationally, effective
               spatial policies should be implemented, and user-friendly spaces
               should be created to promote the development of effectively
               managed urban areas. Cities are often compared to living
               organisms, which is why social mobility is a crucial determinant
               of urban development and is often used in assessments of cities.
               To address the above needs, a universal and innovative
               methodology for assessing the age-friendly walkability (AFW) of
               urban public spaces was developed and tested in the present
               study. The methodology was developed based on a review of the
               current trends in age-friendly cities, a survey of the target
               population, and a self-designed concept for evaluating the
               walkability of pedestrian routes in public space. The proposed
               methodology not only contributes to the existing knowledge but
               also has practical implications because it was tested in a Polish
               city to classify the 15 minute walkability of pedestrian routes
               and to identify Strategic Intervention Areas for the 60+
               population (SAI 60+). This innovative approach to walkable urban
               public spaces is a simple tool for developing senior-friendly
               planning solutions in cities. The developed paper constitutes a
               basis for precise spatial planning it is based on reliable data
               by conducting a full and comprehensive spatial inventory of
               mobility trajectories of older people walkability. The aim of the

               micro-level is limited. This study aims to reduce older

               environments through infrastructure policies derived from
               statistical data analysis. Special attention is focused on
               collecting a holistic set of infrastructure variables to reflect
               most of the street built environment elements, which helps
               policymakers implement short-term safety measures. Using Bayesian
               Poisson regression, this study analyzes factors contributing to
               the occurrence of crashes involving older and non-older
               pedestrians on road segments in Madrid, Spain. The results
               indicate that different factors affect the occurrence of crashes
               for all pedestrians versus older pedestrians specifically.
               Traffic crashes involving all pedestrians are affected by leisure
               points of interest, bus stops, and crosswalk density. Older
               pedestrian traffic crashes are influenced by population density,
               the presence of trees and trash containers, and contour
               complexity. Proposed measures include relocating trees and trash
               containers, modifying bus stops, and adding crosswalks and
               traffic lights. This paper also shows that these countermeasures,
               aimed at creating age-friendly streets for older pedestrians, are
               not expected to worsen the road safety of other pedestrians.",

  abstract  = "Our paper suggests that changes of the inner urban built form
               could be explained as a result of a process of self-organized
               criticality. Similar to the general behaviour of such kind of a
               system, urban built form grows discretely up to a point in which
               new additions could occur both in the boundaries and in inner
               areas. Once reached this critical point, the urban system stays
               around it, combining outer and inner growth. While outer growth
               is quantitative and does not modify the system’s structure, inner
               growth is qualitative as well as quantitative and can transform
               urban centrality. Replacement of old structures by new ones
               always occurs with extraordinary capital concentration,
               developing new polarization inside the urban fabric. The
               hypothesis is tested through the comparative evolution of
               different land, built form and location values within a period of
               continuous urban growth. Comparative indicator values are

               satisfaction. These four variables are measured using a number of
               statements on a Likert scale which are confirmed to have
               completed the validity and reliability tests. Data were collected
               using a questionnaire which was distributed to 271 respondents
               based on convenience sampling. Furthermore, the data were
               obtained and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM)
               and the Sobel test as a basis for hypothesis testing. The results
               of the hypothesis test explain the rejection of the null
               hypothesis, which means that there is support for empirical data
               on the proposed research hypothesis. This illustrates that
               authenticity and walkability directly affect tourist satisfaction
               positively and significantly. Meanwhile, revisit intention is
               influenced positively and significantly both directly by
               authenticity and walkability and indirectly through tourist
               satisfaction. Thus, all attributes of authenticity and
               walkability have a very important role in fulfilling tourists'
               expectations when appreciating historical buildings in a heritage
               tourism area. The authenticity attributes of historical buildings
               that need the attention of relevant stakeholders are historical
               value, authenticity, originality, and maintenance. Some of the
               critical elements of walkability that also need to be maintained
               such as security, comfort, accessibility, connections with other
               destinations, and pedestrian friendliness for pedestrians.",

              the spatial changes over time to evaluate the shifting identity of
              the area that was in the past an immigrant quarter and presently a
              celebrated gay village. The approach, therefore, combines
              analytical methods, such as network analysis, historical
              morphology analysis and distribution of land uses over time, with
              empirical methods, such as observations, auto-ethnography,

              ability to reinvent over time, when viewed through the prism of

              maintaining a time-space relationship and organisation of

              relationship between people and culture with their physical
              environment, where they manifest through the various practices and
              occupational distribution. In the case of Soho, the research found
              that there was a clear distribution of specific communities along
              specific streets over a certain period in the history. The gay
              bars were situated along Rupert and Old Compton Street, whereas
              the Jewish and Irish traders were established on Berwick Street,
              and so on. Upon spatial analysis of Soho and its surrounding
              areas, it was found that the streets of Soho were unlike that of
              its surrounding neighbourhoods. In Soho, the streets were
              organised with a certain level of hierarchy, and this hierarchy
              also shifted over time. This impacted the distribution of landuses
              within the area over time. Street hierarchy was measured through
              mathematical modelling of streets as derived by space syntax. In
              doing so, the research enabled viewing spaces and communities as
              evolving in parallel over time. In conclusion, by mapping the
              activities and the spatiality of Soho’s various cultural
              inhabitants over three historical periods and connecting these
              changes to the changing spatial morphology of the region, the
              research highlighted the importance of space in establishing the
              evolving nature of Soho. Such changes are visible in both symbolic
              and functional ways, from the location of a Govinda temple on a
              Soho square street, to the rise and fall of culture specific
              landuses such as gay bars on Old Compton Street. The research

               Multiple Fabric Assessment (Araldi and Fusco 2017) are
               geoprocessing quantitative approaches to the analysis of urban
               fabric morphology. This study has two aims; (1) classify
               quantitative urban morphology methods and (2) discuss how these
               methods could be applied in urban design and environmental
               psychology. First, we will present the evolution of these methods
               along with the theories in urban morphology from qualitative to
               quantitative approaches. Then, we will discuss how these methods
               could be combined and used in two related areas: urban design and
               environmental psychology.",

               and historic center of Naples there were abandoned buildings and
               complexes, uninhabited and unused for decades. The cause is
               attributed to multiple reasons such as functional obsolescence,
               failure to adapt to intervening European standards in terms of
               hospital construction, technological facilities to standards,
               etc. The health crisis which strongly affected European societies
               revealed the fragilities of our healthcare systems. In Italy, a
               large number of COVID-19 patients congested hospitals while the
               continuity of essential services was interrupted at the expense
               of other needs. At the same time, the process of abandonment of
               historic buildings affects different monumental hospitals, such
               as the “San Giacomo degli Incurabili” and the “Carlo Forlanini”
               in Rome, or the “Gesù e Maria” Hospital, “San Gennaro dei Poveri”
               and the “Santa Maria del Popolo degli Incurabili” in Naples. This
               paper reports three case studies of Neapolitan historical
               hospitals regeneration proposals with the goal of strengthening
               the existing community healthcare system and developing energy
               efficiency and seismic improvement strategies in the spirit of
               sustainable development. Leveraging the flexibility of monumental
               hospitals, the proposed light retrofit interventions restore the
               historial healthcare functional destination ensuring also the
               reuse of such an heritage. The current research delineates an
               approach to the recovery and enhancement for social and cultural

               approach can positively affect the quality of life of citizens
               and the use of health services, while recovering historical

               family; you can use it to work with your neighbors to improve
               your town and neighborhood; you can use it to design an office,
               or a workshop, or a public building. And you can use it to guide
               you in the actual process of construction. After a ten-year
               silence, Christopher Alexander and his colleagues at the Center
               for Environmental Structure are now publishing a major statement
               in the form of three books which will, in their words, ``lay the
               basis for an entirely new approach to architecture, building and
               planning, which will we hope replace existing ideas and practices
               entirely.'' The three books are The Timeless Way of Building, The
               Oregon Experiment, and this book, A Pattern Language. At the core
               of these books is the idea that people should design for
               themselves their own houses, streets, and communities. This idea
               may be radical (it implies a radical transformation of the
               architectural profession) but it comes simply from the
               observation that most of the wonderful places of the world were
               not made by architects but by the people. At the core of the
               books, too, is the point that in designing their environments
               people always rely on certain ``languages,'' which, like the
               languages we speak, allow them to articulate and communicate an
               infinite variety of designs within a forma system which gives
               them coherence. This book provides a language of this kind. It
               will enable a person to make a design for almost any kind of
               building, or any part of the built environment. ``Patterns,'' the
               units of this language, are answers to design problems (How high
               should a window sill be? How many stories should a building have?
               How much space in a neighborhood should be devoted to grass and
               trees?). More than 250 of the patterns in this pattern language
               are given: each consists of a problem statement, a discussion of
               the problem with an illustration, and a solution. As the authors
               say in their introduction, many of the patterns are archetypal,
               so deeply rooted in the nature of things that it seemly likely
               that they will be a part of human nature, and human action, as
               much in five hundred years as they are today.",

               The reason that more researchers are opting for these types of
               research is that both qualitative and quantitative data are
               simultaneously collected, analyzed and interpreted. In this
               article the main research instruments (questionnaire, interview
               and classroom observation) usually used in the mixed method
               designs are presented and elaborated on. It is believed that
               using different types of procedures for collecting data and
               obtaining that information through different sources (learners,
               teachers, program staff, etc.) can augment the validity and
               reliability of the data and their interpretation. Therefore, the
               various ways of boosting the validity and reliability of the data

  abstract = "Analysing the relationship between urban form and society through
              time is key to understanding the patterns of socio-spatial
              phenomena observable in contemporary cities and the mechanisms
              through which such phenomena unfold. The engagement of space
              syntax research with historical comparative studies of urban form
              has opened up possibilities for studying the relationship between
              urban development and social phenomena through time. The theory
              and methods of space syntax have a positive contribution to make
              to this research agenda. They need, however, to be better
              integrated within a multifaceted research framework. While space
              syntax provides a reliable methodology to compare the city’s urban
              form at different points in time, the evolution of a city’s
              spatial structure is only one component of the processes which
              shape the city as a social entity. In recent years, relational
              theories such as Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and assemblage theory
              have highlighted the value of integrating different social science
              approaches in the analysis of social entities if we are to truly
              understand the complex processes which define the ways in which
              the social is realised in urban form. Although the implications of
              these theories in geography and urban studies have been widely
              explored, their relevance to space syntax research has received
              little attention. A meditation on their possible relationship
              informs the research presented in this paper. Drawing on key
              findings of an ongoing research project into the relation between
              social and spatial changes in the city of Nicosia through time
              (1883-2014), the argument advanced is that a critical reflection
              on the ways in which syntactical theory can engage with approaches
              from other disciplines is needed to inform methodological
              developments and facilitate the better interpretation of research
              findings in making spatial sense of historical social data.",

               traditionally studied face-to-face interaction as part of the
               area of “collective behavior”; the units of social organization
               involved are those that can form by virtue of a breakdown in
               ordinary social intercourse: crowds, mobs, panics, riots. The
               other aspect of the problem of face-to-face interaction—the units
               of organization in which orderly and uneventful face-to-face
               interaction occurs—has been neglected until recently, although
               there is some early work on classroom interaction, topics of
               conversation, committee meetings, and public assemblies.Instead
               of dividing face-to-face interaction into the eventful and the
               routine, I propose a different division—into unfocused
               interaction and focused interaction. Unfocused interaction
               consists of those interpersonal communications that result solely
               by virtue of persons being in one another’s presence, as when two
               strangers across the room from each other check up on each
               other’s clothing, posture, and general manner, while each
               modifies his own demeanor because he himself is under
               observation. Focused interaction occurs when people effectively
               agree to sustain for a time a single focus of cognitive and
               visual attention, as in a conversation, a board game, or a joint
               task sustained by a close face-to-face circle of contributors.
               Those sustaining together a single focus of attention will, of
               course, engage one another in unfocused interaction, too. They
               will not do so in their capacity as participants in the focused
               activity, however, and persons present who are not in the focused
               activity will equally participate in this unfocused
               interaction.The two papers in this volume are concerned with
               focused interaction only. I call the natural unit of social
               organization in which focused interaction occurs a focused
               gathering, or an encounter, or a situated activity system. I
               assume that instances of this natural unit have enough in common
               to make it worthwhile to study them as a type. Three different
               terms are used out of desperation rather than by design; as will
               be suggested, each of the three in its own way is unsatisfactory,
               and each is satisfactory in a way that the others are not. The
               two essays deal from different points of view with this single
               unit of social organization. The first paper, “Fun in Games,”
               approaches focused gatherings from an examination of the kind of
               games that are played around a table. The second paper, “Role
               Distance,” approaches focused gatherings through a review and
               criticism of social-role analysis.The study of focused gatherings
               has been greatly stimulated recently by the study of group
               psychotherapy and especially by “small-group analysis.” I feel,
               however, that full use of this work is impeded by a current
               tendency to identify focused gatherings too easily with social
               groups. A small but interesting area of study is thus obscured by
               the biggest title, “social group,” that can be found for it.",

               environments around the world based on his research into the ways
               people actually use—or could use—the spaces where they live and
               work. In this revolutionary book, Gehl presents his latest work
               creating (or recreating) cityscapes on a human scale. He clearly
               explains the methods and tools he uses to reconfigure unworkable
               cityscapes into the landscapes he believes they should be: cities
               for people. Taking into account changing demographics and
               changing lifestyles, Gehl emphasizes four human issues that he
               sees as essential to successful city planning. He explains how to
               develop cities that are Lively, Safe, Sustainable, and Healthy.
               Focusing on these issues leads Gehl to think of even the largest
               city on a very small scale. For Gehl, the urban landscape must be
               considered through the five human senses and experienced at the
               speed of walking rather than at the speed of riding in a car or
               bus or train. This small-scale view, he argues, is too frequently
               neglected in contemporary projects. In a final chapter, Gehl
               makes a plea for city planning on a human scale in the fast-
               growing cities of developing countries. A “Toolbox,” presenting
               key principles, overviews of methods, and keyword lists,
               concludes the book. The book is extensively illustrated with over
               700 photos and drawings of examples from Gehl’s work around the

                  human subsystem made up of movement, interaction and activity.

                  Any reasonable theory of urban complexity would need to link
                  the social and technical subsystems to each other.
                  Historically, most urban models have sought to make the link
                  through the concept of distance in the physical system as a
                  cost in the social system, defining the physical subsystem as
                  a set of discrete zones. Such models have proved practical
                  tools, but over the years have contributed relatively little
                  to the development of a more general theory of the city. Here
                  we propose a more complex and, we believe, true-to-life model
                  based on the definition of the physical subsystem of the city
                  as a network of spaces-streets and roads-linking buildings,
                  rather than as a system of discrete zones. This allows us to

  author    = "Farías, Ignacio and Bender, Thomas",

  abstract  = "This book takes it as a given that the city is made of multiple
               partially localized assemblages built of heterogeneous networks,
               spaces, and practices. The past century of urban studies has
               focused on various aspects—space, culture, politics, economy—but
               these too often address each domain and the city itself as a
               bounded and cohesive entity. The multiple and overlapping
               enactments that constitute urban life require a commensurate
               method of analysis that encompasses the human and non-human
               aspects of cities—from nature to socio-technical networks, to
               hybrid collectivities, physical artefacts and historical
               legacies, and the virtual or imagined city. This book
               proposes—and its various chapters offer demonstrations—importing
               into urban studies a body of theories, concepts, and perspectives
               developed in the field of science and technology studies (STS)
               and, more specifically, Actor-Network Theory (ANT). The essays
               examine artefacts, technical systems, architectures, place and
               eventful spaces, the persistence of history, imaginary and
               virtual elements of city life, and the politics and ethical
               challenges of a mode of analysis that incorporates multiple
               actors as hybrid chains of causation. The chapters are attentive
               to the multiple scales of both the object of analysis and the
               analysis itself. The aim is more ambitious than the mere transfer
               of a fashionable template. The authors embrace ANT critically, as
               much as a metaphor as a method of analysis, deploying it to think
               with, to ask new questions, to find the language to achieve more
               compelling descriptions of city life and of urban
               transformations. By greatly extending the chain or network of
               causation, proliferating heterogeneous agents, non-human as well
               as human, without limit as to their enrolment in urban
               assemblages, Actor-Network Theory offers a way of addressing the
               particular complexity and openness characteristic of cities. By
               enabling an escape from the reification of the city so common in
               social theory, ANT’s notion of hybrid assemblages offers richer
               framing of the reality of the city—of urban experience—that is
               responsive to contingency and complexity. Therefore Urban
               Assemblages is a pertinent book for students, practitioners and
               scholars as it aims to shift the parameters of urban studies and
               contribute a meaningful argument for the urban arena which will
               dominate the coming decades in government policies.",

                  be in placeto be here / there'' (T. Cresswell. Towards
                  Topopoetics: Space, Place and the Poem, 2017). If place refers
                  to the area around the humans, space re fers more to the
                  cosmos, it means that it is wider than place in terms of the
                  amount. ``[S]pace is seen as limitless, empty, divisible and
                  subject to math ematical forms of understanding while place is
                  seen as bounded, full, unique and subject to forms of
                  interpretive understanding'' (Towards Topopoetics). Space
                  becomes place through experience. This means that there is a
                  deep relationship between place and culture, because through
                  culture place can be identified. In her book Spatializing
                  Culture: The Ethnography o f Space and Place (2017) Setha Low
                  gives an overview o f theoretical approaches to space and
                  place by philosophers, social theorists, geographers,
                  anthropologists, environmental psychologists and architects.
                  She demonstrates that those who view place as the predominant
                  construct rely on phenomenological theories and epistemologies
                  and those who use space as the all-encompassing construct rely
                  on Marxism, neo-Marxism, mathematics, geometry and historical
                  materialism as their theoreti cal foundations. For example,
                  Edward Casey who draws on the w ork of the phenomenologists
                  Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty argues that space is
                  a modem concept preceded by the premodem notion o f place. He
                  suggests that ``place is primary and the universal form of all
                  human existence''",

               inventing things which display new physical order, organization,
               form, in response to function.'' This book, opening with these
               words, presents an entirely new theory of the process of
               design.In the first part of the book, Christopher Alexander
               discusses the process by which a form is adapted to the context
               of human needs and demands that has called it into being. He
               shows that such an adaptive process will be successful only if it
               proceeds piecemeal instead of all at once. It is for this reason
               that forms from traditional un-self-conscious cultures, molded
               not by designers but by the slow pattern of changes within
               tradition, are so beautifully organized and adapted. When the
               designer, in our own self-conscious culture, is called on to
               create a form that is adapted to its context he is unsuccessful,
               because the preconceived categories out of which he builds his
               picture of the problem do not correspond to the inherent
               components of the problem, and therefore lead only to the
               arbitrariness, willfulness, and lack of understanding which
               plague the design of modern buildings and modern cities.In the
               second part, Mr. Alexander presents a method by which the
               designer may bring his full creative imagination into play, and
               yet avoid the traps of irrelevant preconception. He shows that,
               whenever a problem is stated, it is possible to ignore existing
               concepts and to create new concepts, out of the structure of the
               problem itself, which do correspond correctly to what he calls
               the subsystems of the adaptive process. By treating each of these
               subsystems as a separate subproblem, the designer can translate
               the new concepts into form. The form, because of the process,
               will be well-adapted to its context, non-arbitrary, and
               correct.The mathematics underlying this method, based mainly on
               set theory, is fully developed in a long appendix. Another
               appendix demonstrates the application of the method to the design
               of an Indian village.",

               has defined and redefined the relationship between politics,
               capitalism, and the social aspects of geographical theory. Laying
               out Harvey's position that geography could not remain objective
               in the face of urban poverty and associated ills, Social Justice
               and the City is perhaps the most widely cited work in the field.
               Harvey analyzes core issues in city planning and
               policy--employment and housing location, zoning, transport costs,
               concentrations of poverty--asking in each case about the
               relationship between social justice and space. How, for example,
               do built-in assumptions about planning reinforce existing
               distributions of income? Rather than leading him to liberal,
               technocratic solutions, Harvey's line of inquiry pushes him in
               the direction of a ``revolutionary geography,'' one that
               transcends the structural limitations of existing approaches to
               space. Harvey's emphasis on rigorous thought and theoretical
               innovation gives the volume an enduring appeal. This is a book
               that raises big questions, and for that reason geographers and

               architectural variable of form? A theory of description is

               once spatial form is describable in terms of a descriptive
               theory, a more powerfully scientific - and architectural -
               understanding of function is possible. The argument draws on
               several pieces of research carried out by the authors and their
               students, but focusses eventually on various types of medical
               building in order to illustrate certain general principles.",

              very imageable city would facilitate urban orientation and
              wayfinding performance. However, in addition to spatial
              information other external information like navigational aids and
              social environment could assist navigators to reach their desired
              destinations easier. With the ubiquity of “wayshowing” tools such
              as paper maps, digital maps, smart phone navigators, and local

              unfamiliar environment and find their desired destinations. Each
              of these tools provides specific spatial information in particular

              physical urban elements are not the only characteristics that

              use are other influential factors that influence people’s route

              different wayfinding tools, such as paper maps, GPS and
              non-mapping on an individual’s spatial cognition; b) the effects

              were recruited and placed in one of the three groups, given
              different wayfinding tools, and asked to find seven pre-determined

              methods were used including GPS tracking, think-aloud recordings,
              sketch mapping, other cognitive tests and post-test interviews,
              combined with built environment analysis using space syntax. The
              results showed clear differences in the cognitive tests across the
              three groups of participants who navigated using different
              wayfinding tools (GPS, maps, paper maps, signage only). The GPS
              group neither were the best nor the worst compared with the two
              other groups. However, this is not seemingly because they were
              looking more at their devices and not looking around, as
              think-aloud utterances showed no significant difference in
              mentions of landmarks between the groups. But passively following

              mapping, space syntax techniques, and post-test interview in

              experimenting and probing, along with understanding and testing.
              It is about making, learning by doing, and thinking in acting.
              Because design begins by understanding the existing space with its
              living culture, potentials, constraints, variables, and needs;
              architects must first gain a conception of the architectural space
              by decoding the characteristics of its culture and discovering the
              messages revealed via its built form. It is only then that created
              ideas or concepts for that specific space and for specific
              purposes can become concrete and then tested and evaluated.
              Architects must explore the intrinsic nature of the space in
              question to evaluate their ideas and to understand the possible
              effects of their design proposals and to conceive what their
              solution means in terms of their implications and consequences.
              This kind of awareness helps the architect enrich his or her
              understanding of space and forms the architect’s own spatial
              knowledge. Architects should also be aware of different tools and
              knowledge resources that are valuable in thinking about space and
              they should have an ability to transform their spatial knowledge
              into design process. This study investigates the way how
              undergraduate students of architecture perceive the space in which
              they themselves are learning to become architects. This
              investigation looks at students' achievements in the elective
              course “Architectural Morphology” which was given at the School of
              Architecture of Istanbul Technical University during the Fall 2009
              and Fall 2010 semesters. The course leads students to use an
              analytical tool that goes beyond mere intuition and personal
              experience, namely space syntax, to lead them to a set of new
              spatial discoveries related to their own learning environment. In
              this way some of the students come to understand that they have
              relationships with the space that they had not previously
              realized, while others are now able to express in words the spaces
              that were hitherto only visually familiar to them. The creation of
              a discussion platform in this course has the potential of guiding
              the students to better understand concepts related to space
              syntax, to think about space, and gives them a lexicon whereby
              then can discuss spatial elements and concerns.",

  abstract  = "There has recently been a growing interest in the spatial causes
               of poverty, particularly in the processes involved in the
               formation of poverty areas within cities. Most research has
               concentrated on the social causes of poverty, crime and social
               malaise and there is a lack of fundamental research into the
               relationship between urban morphology and the spatialisation of
               poverty. This paper aims to address this deficiency. This paper
               describes research conducted for an EPSRC project called “Space
               and Exclusion”, which aims to investigate the relationship
               between physical segregation and economic marginalisation in the
               city, focusing on 19th century and contemporary London. By using
               a GIS system to layer historical spatial and poverty data along
               with contemporary deprivation indexes and space syntax measures
               of segregation, this paper presents findings on underlying
               spatial effects which influence the spatial distribution of
               poverty, investigates these effects on immigrants in particular,
               and maps the development of “poverty areas” over time. The paper
               also describes the methods used to model the range of data
               sources, which included the data derived from the Charles Booth
               maps of London Poverty 1889 and 1899; using a variety of the
               latest advances in space syntax methods, such as segment
               analysis, which is a finer form analysis than the traditional
               axial map that analyses the line segment between junctions. This
               means that the axial analysis measures of Radius 3 integration,
               Radius n integration and so on can be supplemented with measures
               relating to the spatial integration of the street segment.
               Moreover, metric distance, least angle distance can be analysed,
               as well as – what was vital for the project discussed here –
               analysing the relationship between these spatial measures and
               social data that varies along a single axial line. The authors’
               findings relate to the socio-spatial structure of historical
               London, and pave the way for a comparative spatial model for
               examining the distribution of poverty in contemporary urban
               situations. The paper demonstrates that individuals marginalized
               socially or economically follow distinctive patterns of
               settlement and that underlying these patterns were spatial
               conditions that may have influenced this distribution. For
               example, space syntax analysis suggests that Booth’s London was
               not well integrated on a North-South axis, resulting in a split
               between East-West encounters, which was reflected in an East-West
               prosperity/poverty divide. It examines some of the more localised
               poverty areas and the effects that slum clearance had on the
               surrounding neighbourhoods of the London cityscape. Often,
               interruptions to the grid structure significantly influenced the
               spatial configuration of a poverty area, giving rise to
               conditions of spatial and social segregation. This paper
               concludes that the urban structure itself can influence the
               economic conditions for segregation. Poorer classes are often
               disadvantaged by being marginalized spatially, and the formation
               of poor areas is the outcome of a complex socio-spatial process,
               which can be further influenced by the impact of immigrants to an
               area.",

               Christopher Alexander believes, is bankrupt. More and more people
               are aware that something is deeply wrong. Yet the power of
               present-day ideas is so great that many feel uncomfortable, even
               afraid, to say openly that they dislike what is happening,
               because they are afraid to seem foolish, afraid perhaps that they
               will be laughed at.Now, at last, there is a coherent theory which
               describes in modern terms an architecture as ancient as human
               society itself.The Timeless Way of Building is the introductory
               volume in the Center for Environmental Structure series,
               Christopher Alexander presents in it a new theory of
               architecture, building, and planning which has at its core that
               age-old process by which the people of a society have always
               pulled the order of their world from their own being.Alexander
               writes, ``There is one timeless way of building. It is thousands
               of years old, and the same today as it has always been. The great
               traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and
               temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by
               people who were very close to the center of this way. And as you
               will see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings
               which are themselves as ancient in their form as the trees and

               associated radical changes in space with no less radical changes
               in social institutions. But we do not know how far these linkages
               were contingent or necessary. We do not, in short, have a theory
               of society and space adequate to account for where we are now,
               and therefore we have no reasonable theoretical base for
               speculating about the future. In this paper, I suggest that a
               major reason for this theoretical deficit is that most previous
               attempts to build a theory of society and space have looked at
               society and tried to find space in its output. The result has
               been that the constructive role of space in creating and and
               sustaining society has not been brought to the fore, or if it
               has, only in a way which is too general to permit the detailed
               specification of mechanisms. In this paper I try to reverse the
               normal order of things this by looking first at space and trying
               the discern society through space: by looking at society through
               the prism of space. Through this I try to define key mechanisms
               linking space to society and then use these to suggest how the
               questions about the future of cities and societies might be
               better defined.",

               Past and Present announces an innovative research agenda for
               urban studies in which themes and methods from urban history,
               social theory and built environment research are brought into
               dialogue across disciplinary and chronological boundaries. The
               collection confronts the recurrent epistemological impasse that
               arises between research focussing on the description of material
               built environments and that which is concerned primarily with the
               people who inhabit, govern and write about cities past and
               present. A reluctance to engage substantively with this issue has
               been detrimental to scholarly efforts to understand the urban
               built environment as a meaningful agent of human social
               experience. Drawing on a wide range of historical and
               contemporary urban case studies, as well as a selection of
               theoretical and methodological reflections, the contributions to
               this volume seek to historically, geographically and
               architecturally contextualize diverse spatial practices including
               movement, encounter, play, procession and neighbourhood. The aim
               is to challenge their tacit treatment as universal categories in
               much writing on cities and to propose alternative research
               possibilities with implications as much for urban design thinking
               as for history and the social sciences.",

  abstract  = "This dissertation investigates retail location patterns in urban
               settings -- a domain that has received relatively little
               attention in recent decades. We analyze which land use, urban
               form, and agglomeration factors explain observed retail patterns
               in an empirical case study of Cambridge and Somerville, MA. We
               are particularly interested in whether and how the distribution
               of retailers is affected by the spatial configuration of the
               built environment -- the physical pattern of urban
               infrastructure, the spacing and sizes of buildings, and the
               geometry of circulation routes. We argue that understanding
               retail location patterns in urban settings is not only important
               for improving retail location theory, but also essential for
               designing economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable
               urban neighborhoods. The dissertation proposes a novel
               graph-analysis framework in which retail location patterns can be
               represented under realistic constraints of urban geometry, land
               use distribution, and travel behavior. A series of spatial
               accessibility metrics, which we hypothesize to affect retail
               location choices, are introduced and applied in this framework
               using individual buildings as units of analysis. In order to test
               the statistical significance of these different metrics on retail
               location choices, we adopt the strategic interaction methodology
               from spatial econometrics and apply it for the first time in the
               context of location studies. We specify a linear probability
               model with a binary dependent variable and estimate how
               buildings' probabilities to accommodate retail establishments
               relate endogenously to other retailers' location choices and
               exogenously to both land use and urban form characteristics
               around each building. We apply the model to all retail and
               food-service establishments as a group and to different
               three-digit NAICS establishment categories individually. The
               results confirm that retail location choices in our study area
               are significantly related to both other retailers' endogenous
               location choices and exogenous land use characteristics around
               each building. However, controlling for both of these factors, we
               find that the spatial distribution of retail activity is also
               significantly related to the geometry of the built environment.
               By setting constraints on accessibility, visibility, adjacency,
               and density, the geometry of the built environment produces a
               rich landscape of information that appears to guide opportunities
               for business from building to building. The findings inform
               economists and planners about factors that attract retailers in
               urban settings, and urban designers about how the seemingly basic
               act of laying out streets, parcels and buildings can affect the
               location choices retail and service land uses, thereby shaping
               the economic structure of the city in important ways.",

               Depthmap version 4. Depthmap is primarily a computer program to
               perform visibility analysis of architectural and urban systems.
               It takes input in the form of a plan of the system, and is able
               to construct a map of `visually integrated' locations within it.
               In addition, the most recent version of Depthmap now supplies a
               range of configurational analyses which come under the umbrella
               term of `space syntax'. Space syntax analyses examine the
               relationships between components of space; each analysis starts
               with a representation of the spatial components, then makes a
               graph of these components, and finally analyses this graph using,
               for the most part, conventional graph theoretical measures. The
               analyses available within Depthmap include the original
               visibility analysis, generation and analysis of axial maps as
               well as segment analysis. In addition, a plug-in module gives
               users the ability to perform agent-based analysis, and a
               `software developers' kit' (SDK) allows users to program their
               own graph analysis. Depthmap was first written for the Silicon
               Graphics IRIX operating system as a simple isovist processing
               program in 1998. Since then it has gone through several
               metamorphoses to reach the current version 4, for the Windows
               platform. It is designed to run on Windows 2000 and XP operating
               systems. This document is still in draft form; as yet, figures
               are still to be added, as are the appendices. The version of
               Depthmap it describes (4.06r) is newly released. iii",

               fascinating look at how the contemporary world is characterized
               by an extraordinary social complexity. Since most social
               entities, from small communities to large nation-states would
               disappear altogether if our cognitive abilities ceased to exist,
               DeLanda proposes a novel approach to social ontology that asserts
               the autonomy of social entities from the conceptions we have of
               them. He argues that Gilles Deleuze's theory of assemblages
               provides a framework in which sociologists and geographers
               studying social networks and regions can properly locate their
               work and fully elucidate the connections between them. Indeed,
               assemblage theory, as DeLanda argues, can be used to model any
               community, from interpersonal networks and institutional
               organizations, to central governments, cities and nation states.",

               provides the first detailed overview of the assemblage theory
               found in germ in Deleuze and Guattari's writings. Through a
               series of case studies DeLanda shows how the concept can be
               applied to economic, linguistic and military history as well as
               to metaphysics, science and mathematics.DeLanda then presents the
               real power of assemblage theory by advancing it beyond its
               original formulation allowing for the integration of communities,
               institutional organisations, cities and urban regions. And he

               Subjective Evaluations of the Urban Environment: Space Syntax,
               Cognitive Maps, and Urban Legibility. (Under the direction of
               Perver K. Baran and Robin Moore.) To some degree, the urban
               environment can facilitate/limit one?s orientation, depending on
               the structure and characteristics of the physical elements of the
               city. In this regard, Lynch?s concept of legibility has been
               fundamental in the urban design, planning, architecture, and
               environmental design fields for a few decades. Lynch argued that
               a strong legible city could facilitate humans? orientation in the
               city. However, urban design research has also criticized Lynch?s
               work for ignoring the relational characteristics between physical
               elements of the urban environment. Recent research has suggested
               that Space Syntax methodology could address the limitations of
               Lynch?s approach to urban spatial cognition. The study focuses on
               exploring: a) the relationships between human cognitive
               representations and spatial configuration of the urban
               environment, and b) the effects that different spatial
               configurations have on legibility of the environment. Two
               research studies, correlational and experimental, were performed
               in this study. Two neighborhoods, one relatively intelligible and
               the other less so, in Changsha, China, were selected for the
               study areas. The Space Syntax approach was utilized to measure
               spatial configuration of the neighborhoods. Sketch maps,
               recognition tests, and interviews were used to measure
               individuals? cognitive representations and their perceived
               legibility of the environment. Overall, the results of the
               correlational study indicated that there exists a positive
               association between cognitive representation and spatial
               configuration. In particular, the multiple regression analysis
               showed that global integration is the only significant variable
               explaining the variation in landmark scores, whereas local
               syntactical measures (local integration and connectivity) do not
               play a role in predicting landmark scores. For paths, the
               multiple regression analysis showed that local syntactical
               measures (local integration and connectivity) are the two
               significant variables explaining the variation in path scores,
               whereas global integration does not play a role in predicting
               path scores. The results from the experimental study indicated
               that participants? mean path scores in the sketch maps, the mean
               scores of scene recognition, and the three mean scores of spatial
               cognition ability in a more intelligible neighborhood are much
               higher than those in a less intelligible one. However, no
               difference in landmark recognition was found between the high and
               low intelligible neighborhoods. Overall, the findings suggest
               that the more intelligible an area is, measured by Space Syntax
               as objective value of spatial configuration, the more legibly it
               is reflected in a human?s spatial cognition.",

  author    = "Georgiou, Dion",
  publisher = "Queen Mary University of London",
  abstract  = "The Ilford Carnival was a procession of costumed individuals and
               decorated vehicles held annually in this then outer-lying London
               suburb between 1905 and 1914 to raise funds for establishing a
               local hospital. This thesis utilises the carnival to provide an
               insight into how different suburban organisations and social
               groups came together in a particular performance of community. It
               argues that the carnival’s administrative body, and other
               organisations involved, provided opportunities for inclusion and
               social capital attainment. It also demonstrates how a local
               culture of voluntary action provided the basis of a large-scale
               charitable initiative with an ethos of communal self-help. The
               suburban setting demonstrates the continued relevance of
               carnival, originating in the premodern ritual year, within a
               modern urban environment. In the wake of Ilford’s drastic
               expansion, the carnival’s annual recurrence provided reassuring
               familiarity, and an opportunity for inversionary performances,
               with the carnival’s philanthropic rationale providing a
               justification for what might have otherwise been seen as
               transgressive. The thesis illustrates that the procession
               functioned as a suburban public sphere. Performances throughout
               operated between poles of artifice and sincerity, with dominant
               ideals about national and imperial identity, or class and gender
               roles, being projected through acts of dressing up, while such
               ideals were both transgressed and upheld through practices like
               crossdressing and blackface. The suburb too was reimagined, as
               both rural idyll and metropolitan tourist attraction. It also
               highlights how the carnival’s timing, structure and content were
               impinged upon and influenced by expanding cultural industries,
               with the carnival commodified by participating businesses and
               media, but also appropriating fundraising models and imagery from
               commercialised formats like sport and theatre, connoting the
               topicality and recognisability that enabled it to compete within
               the metropolitan market for people’s spare time and money.",

               and management. The authors - an architect/environmental
               designer, a landscape architect, an environmental psychologist,
               and an open space administrator - offer a well-integrated
               perspective of how to integrate public space and public life.
               They contend that three critical human dimensions should guide
               the process of design and management of public space: the users'
               essential needs, their spatial rights, and the meanings they
               seek. To develop and explain these three dimensions, the authors
               draw on the history of public life and public space, evidence
               from recent social research, and a series of original case
               studies, all amply illustrated. Public Space offers an innovative
               approach for adapting the dimensions to the unique social and
               environmental context of each project.",

              theories of modernity and developmentalism which scholars of urban
              studies have questioned. In the first part of the paper, I bring
              into conversation the two discussions-the first of urban studies
              scholars and the second of the Latin American social theorists
              whose critique of Eurocentrism, called the decolonial position
              presents, in my opinion an entry point for a way to do global
              social science. The second part of this paper looks at the system

              pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics increasing the risk of side
              effects. The decline in renal function affects the elimination of
              many drugs. Before prescribing an estimation of the glomerular
              filtration rate is of the highest importance. All the nomogramms
              and formulae are approximate in the oldest old. The Cockcroft and
              Gault formula is frequently used. Pharmacodynamic alterations are
              particularly important for the centrally active drugs that older
              people are more vulnerable to, for example increased and prolonged
              effects of anticholinergic, hypnotic and sedative drugs.
              Polypharmacy and self-medication is also common in these patients,

               424 images on four design attributes purported to influence
               walkability: variation in building height, variation in building
               plane, presence of ground-floor windows, and presence of a street
               focal point. We then presented the images to 45 adults, who were

               perceived walkability varied according to the degree to which a

               have claimed and conquered the metropolitan vision. This paper
               travels back in time to look for the foundations of these cities’
               architectural and urban morphology. The study is focused on the
               architecture of the everyday, the vernacular buildings which
               collectively form the character of a city’s historical built
               environment. It discusses how both preconceived frameworks and
               emergent architectural decisions and societal rules have shaped
               the two cities throughout their spatial histories. Drawing
               evidence from historical and empirical data the analysis
               presented in this paper builds on space syntax research which
               investigates morphological processes in urban configurations. The
               paper looks at two contrasting cases of urban grids to contribute
               to the understanding of the way different spatial arrangements
               influence city form. The urban past of London and Manhattan is
               considered in terms of planning intentions, architecture, urban
               form and the embodied socio-cultural models and ideals. The
               approach emphasises the way architectural and urban scales were
               configured together to produce each city’s historical
               morphological identity and spatial culture. This stems from an
               effort to form a parallel understanding of both the building unit
               and the urban realm where this is situated. In this perspective,
               the discussion provides an overview on the one hand, of the
               building aggregation rules of the London terraced house and the
               Manhattan row house schemes; and on the other hand, the structure
               of the urban grid in each case. The aim is to shed light on the
               interplay of these two elements, underlining the challenge for
               any urban design approach: to tackle both buildings and streets
               along the lines of a unifying and diachronic spatial logic. The
               study considers the syntactical and morphological properties of
               urban space, looking at the building, the block and the city
               scales. The paper aims to highlight that both for London and
               Manhattan there exist inherent cross-scale organisational
               consistencies that hold the spatial cultures of each city
               together.",

  abstract  = "In recent years, relational theories, including assemblage
               theory, have brought new perspectives to urban studies and
               challenged the ways through which researchers approach the study
               of the urban environment in their effort to truly understand the
               complex processes that define the ways in which the social is
               reflected in the urban form and vice versa. Although the
               implications of assemblage theory for urban studies, in
               particular critical urban theory, have been explored, a closer
               look on how this theory could be related to space syntax theory
               and the methods it employs has not yet been taken. A discourse on
               such a relationship lies at the heart of this paper, which
               focuses on Manuel DeLanda's idea of cities as assemblages
               (DeLanda, 2006) and space syntax's concepts and tools which
               appear to describe urban properties that fit this notion. The aim
               of the paper is to address the points made by Netto (2016) about
               the future of theory and the need to engage with new concepts and
               interact with ideas other than those from which each researcher
               starts their journey. In his words new approaches are needed to
               ``escape the dead ends into which the different strands of urban
               socio-spatial knowledge have been drawn''. The authors believe
               that an exploration of the linkages between assemblage and space
               syntax theories is a fundamental step forward in broadening space
               syntax's focus on a wider range of possible relations, and thus
               strengthening it as a socio-spatial theory. The paper starts with
               a discursive analysis comparing assemblage and space syntax
               theories. It then offers a detailed text analysis of chapter 5
               (Cities and Nations) of DeLanda's A New Philosophy of Society.
               Based on the text analysis, relevant key space syntax concepts
               and their measuring tools are discussed in terms of their
               similarity to the definitions of components and processes which
               characterize cities as assemblages, as well as of their potential
               as tools for assemblage analysis. The main concepts discussed are
               connectivity, integration, segregation, centrality and scales of
               analysis. The main criticism to assemblage thinking as a
               potential research approach in urban studies is its genericity
               and lack of analytical specificity. The theory is seen as
               suggestive of themes for research and of methodological
               techniques, yet tending to be indeterminate due to the complexity
               of the theorization of cities as assemblages, the high level of
               contingency in the interaction between different components and
               the potentially infinite scales at which transformation processes
               can occur. This paper's objective is to assess whether assemblage
               theory can be made analytically relevant and specific to urban
               studies by deploying space syntax tools when analytically
               applying assemblage theory. The authors conclude that assemblage
               thinking could be seen as enhancing the theoretical background of
               space syntax and that space syntax tools and concepts could be
               used as practical instruments for assemblage analysis.",

               buildings. In tracing the stages of this transformation, this
               book presents the view that the urban tissue, the intermediate
               scale between the architecture of buildings and the diagrammatic
               layouts of town planning, is the essential framework for everyday
               life. Only by investigating the urban tissue will it be possible
               to understand the complex relationships between plot and built

               to the study of urban form, grounded in the traditions of
               geographical analysis but wholly interdisciplinary in their
               content and implications. It develops a philosophical and
               methodological basis for the field of urban morphology, stressing
               the reciprocal relations between town plan, building fabric and
               land and building utilisation. It views these elements as
               spatially variable accumulations and selective survivals of forms
               regulated by shifting patterns of corporate and individual
               decisions made from one historical period to another - in

  abstract  = "This essential collection of key articles offers a re-evaluation
               of the practice of history in light of current debates. Critical
               thinkers and practicing historians present their writings, along
               with clear and thorough editorial material, to examine the
               complex ideas at the forefront of historical practice. This
               volume gives a synoptic overview of the last twenty-five years’
               theoretical analysis of historical writing, with a critical
               examination of the central concepts and positions that have been
               in debate. The collection delineates the emergence of ``practice
               theory'' as a possible paradigm for future historical
               interpretation concerned with questions of agency, experience and
               the subject. These complex ideas are introduced to students in
               this accessible reader, and for teachers and historians too, this
               survey is an indispensable and timely read.",
